It is a direct consequence of left ventricle failure characterized by high diastolic pressure obstructing the collection of blood from the pulmonary vessels. The occurrence of this situation grows with the increasing time of waiting for OHT, and with the progression of heart failure. Mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices, particularly left ventricular assist devices (LVADs), have emerged as pivotal interventions for patients with fixed PH, offering a potential bridge to transplantation. The pathophysiological impact of PH in heart transplant candidates is profound, as it is associated with increased perioperative risk and heightened mortality post-transplantation. The selection of heart transplant candidates thus mandates a careful evaluation of PH, with an emphasis on distinguishing between reversible and fixed forms of the condition. Reversible PH can often be managed with medical therapies; however, fixed PH presents a more daunting challenge, necessitating more aggressive interventions like MCS. Patients are supported with LVADs until evidence of pulmonary afterload reversal is evident and then can be considered for heart transplantation. However, in those who are non-responders or have complications while being supported, their option for transplant is revoked.

Current phenotyping strategies in PH rely on few invasive hemodynamic parameters to quantify RV dysfunction severity. The aim of this study was to identify novel RV phenotypes using unsupervised clustering methods on advanced hemodynamic features of RV function.\nMETHODS: Participants were identified from the University of Arizona Pulmonary Hypertension Registry (n\u00a0=\u00a0190). RV-pulmonary artery coupling (Ees/Ea), RV systolic (Ees), and diastolic function (Eed) were quantified from stored RV pressure waveforms. Consensus clustering analysis with bootstrapping was used to identify the optimal clustering method. Pearson correlation analysis was used to reduce collinearity between variables. RV cluster subphenotypes were characterized using clinical data and compared to pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) quintiles.\nRESULTS: Five distinct RV clusters (C1-C5) with distinct RV subphenotypes were identified using k-medoids with a Pearson distance matrix. Clusters 1 and 2 both have low diastolic stiffness (Eed) and afterload (Ea) but RV-PA coupling (Ees/Ea) is decreased in C2. Intermediate cluster (C3) has a similar Ees/Ea as C2 but with higher PA pressure and afterload. Clusters C4 and C5 have increased Eed and Ea but C5 has a significant decrease in Ees/Ea. Cardiac output was high in C3 distinct from the other clusters. In the PVR quintiles, contractility increased and stroke volume decreased as a function of increased afterload.

Moreover, diastolic dysfunction has been linked to adverse outcomes after lung transplant. The impact of lung transplant on diastolic dysfunction in recipients with pretransplant pulmonary hypertension is not defined. In this cohort, we aimed to assess the prevalence of diastolic dysfunction, the change in diastolic dysfunction after lung transplant, and the impact of diastolic dysfunction on lung transplant outcomes.\nMETHODS: In a large, single-center database from January 2011 to September 2021, single or bilateral lung transplant recipients with pulmonary hypertension (mean pulmonary artery pressure > 20\u00a0mm Hg) were retrospectively identified. Those without a pre- or post-transplant echocardiogram within 1\u00a0year were excluded. Diastolic dysfunction was diagnosed and graded according to the American Society of Echocardiography 2016 guideline on assessment of diastolic dysfunction (present, absent, indeterminate). McNemar's test was used to examine association between diastolic dysfunction pre- and post-transplant. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analysis were used to assess associations between pre-lung transplant diastolic dysfunction and post-lung transplant 1-year outcomes, including mortality, major adverse cardiac events, and bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome grade 1 or higher-free survival.\nRESULTS: Of 476 primary lung transplant recipients, 205 with pulmonary hypertension formed the study cohort (mean age, 56.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.9\u00a0years, men 61.5%, mean pulmonary artery pressure 30.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.8\u00a0mm Hg, left ventricular ejection fraction\u00a0<\u00a055% 9 [4.3%]). Pretransplant, diastolic dysfunction was present in 93 patients (45.4%) (grade I = 8, II\u00a0=\u00a084, III\u00a0=\u00a01), absent in 16 patients (7.8%), and indeterminate in 89 patients (43.4%), and 7 patients (3.4%) had missing data. Post-transplant, diastolic dysfunction was present in 7 patients (3.4%) (grade I\u00a0=\u00a02, II\u00a0=\u00a05, III\u00a0=\u00a00), absent in 164 patients (80.0%), and indeterminate in 15 patients (7.3%), and 19 patients (9.3%) had missing data. For those with diastolic dysfunction grades in both time periods (n\u00a0=\u00a0180), there was a significant decrease in diastolic dysfunction post-transplant (148/169 patients with resolved diastolic dysfunction; McNemar's test P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). Pretransplant diastolic dysfunction was not associated with major adverse cardiac events (hazard ratio [HR], 1.08, 95% CI, 0.72-1.62; P\u00a0=\u00a0.71), bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome-free survival (HR, 0.67, 95% CI, 0.39-1.56; P\u00a0=\u00a0.15), or mortality (HR, 0.70, 95% CI, 0.33-1.46; P\u00a0=\u00a0.34) at 1\u00a0year.\nCONCLUSIONS: Diastolic dysfunction is highly prevalent in lung transplant candidates with normal left ventricular systolic function and pulmonary hypertension, and resolves in most patients after lung transplant regardless of patient characteristics. Pre-lung transplant diastolic dysfunction was not associated with adverse lung or cardiac outcomes after lung transplant. Collectively, these findings suggest that the presence of diastolic dysfunction in lung transplant recipients with pulmonary hypertension has no prognostic significance, and as such diastolic dysfunction and the associated clinical syndrome of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction should not be considered a relative contraindication to lung transplant in such patients.", "pmid": "37741317", "score": 2, "selected": true}, {"title": "Real-world safety and effectiveness of inhaled nitric oxide therapy for pulmonary hypertension during the perioperative period of cardiac surgery: a post-marketing study of 2817 patients in Japan.", "authors_str": "Matsugi E; Takashima S; Doteguchi S; Kobayashi T; Okayasu M", "doi": "10.1007/s11748-023-01971-2", "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the real-world safety and effectiveness of inhaled nitric oxide (INOflo\nMETHODS: This was a prospective, non-interventional, all-case, post-marketing study of pediatric and adult patients who received perioperative INOflo with cardiac surgery from November 2015-December 2020.

First, a clot score was calculated by assigning the following score: pulmonary trunk-5, each main pulmonary artery-4, each lobar-3, each segmental-2, and subsegmental-1 per lobe; the sum total was then calculated. The perfusion defect (PD) score was calculated by assigning 1 point to each segmental PD. The combined score was calculated by adding clot and PD scores. For quantitative evaluation, we calculated perfused blood volume (PBV) (%) of each lung and the sum of both lungs. Primary endpoints included testing association between combined score and total PBV with change in mean pulmonary arterial pressure ([mPAP], change calculated as preop minus postop values). Secondary endpoints included explorative analysis of the correlation between combined score and PBV with change in preoperative and postoperative pulmonary vascular resistance, change in preoperative 6-minute walk distance (6MWD), and immediate postoperative complications such as reperfusion edema, ECMO placement, stroke, death and mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours, all within 1 month of surgery.\nRESULTS: Higher combined scores were associated with larger decreases in mPAP ( =0.27, P =0.036). On average, the decrease in mPAP (pre mPAP-post mPAP) increased by 2.2\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg (95% CI: -0.6, 5.0) with each 10 unit increase in combined score. The correlation between total PBV and change in mPAP was small and not statistically significant.

Recent studies have shown that diabetes mellitus and impaired lipid metabolism are associated with the severity and prognosis of idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH). However, the relationship between IR and pulmonary hypertension is poorly understood. This study explored the association between four IR indices and IPAH using data from a multicenter cohort.\nMETHODS: A total of 602 consecutive participants with IPAH were included in this study between January 2015 and December 2022. The metabolic score for IR (METS-IR), triglyceride to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (TG/HDL-C) ratio, triglyceride and glucose (TyG) index, and triglyceride-glucose-body mass index (TyG-BMI) were used to quantify IR levels in patients with IPAH. The correlation between non-insulin-based IR indices and long-term adverse outcomes was determined using multivariate Cox regression models and restricted cubic splines.\nRESULTS: During a mean of 3.6\u00a0years' follow-up, 214 participants experienced all-cause death or worsening condition. Compared with in low to intermediate-low risk patients, the TG/HDL-C ratio (2.9\u2009\u00b1\u20091.7 vs. 3.3\u2009\u00b1\u20092.1, P\u2009=\u20090.003) and METS-IR (34.5\u2009\u00b1\u20096.7 vs. 36.4\u2009\u00b1\u20097.5, P\u2009<\u20090.001) were significantly increased in high to intermediate-high risk patients. IR indices correlated with well-validated variables that reflected the severity of IPAH, such as the cardiac index and stroke volume index. Multivariate Cox regression analyses indicated that the TyG-BMI index (hazard ratio [HR] 1.179, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.020, 1.363 per 1.0-standard deviation [SD] increment, P\u2009=\u20090.026) and METS-IR (HR 1.169, 95% CI 1.016, 1.345 per 1.0-SD increment, P\u2009=\u20090.030) independently predicted adverse outcomes. Addition of the TG/HDL-C ratio and METS-IR significantly improved the reclassification and discrimination ability beyond the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) risk score.\nCONCLUSIONS: IR is associated with the severity and long-term prognosis of IPAH.

A defining feature of PAH is the inappropriate remodeling of pulmonary arteries (PA) leading to right ventricle failure and death. Although treatment of PAH has improved, the long-term prognosis for patients remains poor, and more effective targets are needed.\nMETHODS: Gene expression was analyzed by microarray, RNA sequencing, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, and immunostaining of lung and isolated PA in multiple mouse and rat models of pulmonary hypertension (PH) and human PAH. PH was assessed by digital ultrasound, hemodynamic measurements, and morphometry.\nRESULTS: Microarray analysis of the transcriptome of hypertensive rat PA identified a novel candidate, PBK (PDZ-binding kinase), that was upregulated in multiple models and species including humans. PBK is a serine/threonine kinase with important roles in cell proliferation that is minimally expressed in normal tissues but significantly increased in highly proliferative tissues. PBK was robustly upregulated in the medial layer of PA, where it overlaps with markers of smooth muscle cells. Gain-of-function approaches show that active forms of PBK increase PA smooth muscle cell proliferation, whereas silencing PBK, dominant negative PBK, and pharmacological inhibitors of PBK all reduce proliferation. Pharmacological inhibitors of PBK were effective in PH reversal strategies in both mouse and rat models, providing translational significance. In a complementary genetic approach, PBK was knocked out in rats using CRISPR/Cas9 editing, and loss of PBK prevented the development of PH. We found that PBK bound to PRC1 (protein regulator of cytokinesis 1) in PA smooth muscle cells and that multiple genes involved in cytokinesis were upregulated in experimental models of PH and human PAH. Active PBK increased PRC1 phosphorylation and supported cytokinesis in PA smooth muscle cells, whereas silencing or dominant negative PBK reduced cytokinesis and the number of cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle.\nCONCLUSIONS: PBK is a newly described target for PAH that is upregulated in proliferating PA smooth muscle cells, where it contributes to proliferation through changes in cytokinesis and cell cycle dynamics to promote medial thickening, fibrosis, increased PA resistance, elevated right ventricular systolic pressure, right ventricular remodeling, and PH.", "pmid": "38682326", "score": 2, "selected": true}, {"title": "Integrated bioinformatics analysis and experimental animal models identify a robust biomarker and its correlation with the immune microenvironment in pulmonary arterial hypertension.", "authors_str": "Juaiti M; Feng Y; Tang Y; Liang B; Zha L; Yu Z", "doi": "10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e29587", "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) represents a substantial global risk to human health.

ALK1-mutated ECFCs unexpectedly revealed highly similar transcriptomic profiles to controls, both at the baseline and upon stimulation, and normal activation of Smad1/5 that could not be explained by a compensation in cell-surface ALK1 level. Conversely, PAH HMVECs revealed strong transcriptional dysregulations compared to controls with\u2009>\u20091200 DEGs at the baseline. Consequently, because our study involved two variables, ALK1 genotype and BMP stimulation, we performed two-factor differential expression analysis and identified 44 BMP9-dysregulated genes in mutated HMVECs, but none in ECFCs. Yet, the impaired regulation of at least one hit, namely lunatic fringe (LFNG), was validated by RT-qPCR in three different ALK1-mutated endothelial models. In conclusion, ALK1 heterozygosity only modified the BMP9/BMP10 regulation of few genes, including LFNG involved in NOTCH signaling. Future studies will uncover whether dysregulations in such hits are enough to promote HHT/PAH pathogenesis, making them potential therapeutic targets, or if second hits are necessary.", "pmid": "38294582", "score": 3, "selected": true}, {"title": "Peripheral microvascular function is linked to cardiac involvement on cardiovascular magnetic resonance in systemic sclerosis-related pulmonary arterial hypertension.", "authors_str": "Vos JL; Lemmers JMJ; El Messaoudi S; Snoeren M; van Dijk APJ; Duijnhouwer AL; Rodwell L; van Leuven SI; Post MC; Vonk MC; Nijveldt R", "doi": "10.1093/ehjci/jeae001", "abstract": "AIMS: Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is characterized by vasculopathy, inflammation, and fibrosis, and carries one of the worst prognoses if patients also develop pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Although PAH is a known prognosticator, patients with SSc-PAH demonstrate disproportionately high mortality, presumably due to cardiac involvement. In this cross-sectional study, the relationship between cardiac involvement revealed by cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) and systemic microvascular disease severity measured with nailfold capillaromicroscopy (NCM) in patients with SSc-PAH is evaluated and compared with patients with idiopathic PAH (IPAH).\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with SSc-PAH and IPAH underwent CMR, echocardiography, and NCM with post-occlusive reactivity hyperaemia (PORH) testing on the same day. CMR imaging included T2 (oedema), native, and post-contrast T1 mapping to measure the extracellular volume fraction (ECV, fibrosis) and adenosine-stress-perfusion imaging measuring the relative myocardial upslope (microvascular coronary perfusion). Measures of peripheral microvascular function were related to CMR indices of oedema, fibrosis, and myocardial perfusion. SSc-PAH patients (n = 20) had higher T2 values and a trend towards a higher ECV, compared with IPAH patients (n = 5), and a lower nailfold capillary density (NCD) and reduced capillary recruitment after PORH. NCD correlated with ECV and T2 (r = -0.443 and -0.464, respectively, P < 0.05 for both) and with markers of diastolic dysfunction on echocardiography. PORH testing, but not NCD, correlated with the relative myocardial upslope (r = 0.421, P < 0.05).\nCONCLUSION: SSc-PAH patients showed higher markers of cardiac fibrosis and inflammation, compared with IPAH patients. These markers correlated well with peripheral microvascular dysfunction, suggesting that SSc-driven inflammation and vasculopathy concurrently affect peripheral microcirculation and the heart. This may contribute to the disproportionate high mortality in SSc-PAH.", "pmid": "38170546", "score": 3, "selected": true}, {"title": "Performance of DETECT Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Algorithm According to the Hemodynamic Definition of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension in the 2022 European Society of Cardiology and the European Respiratory Society Guidelines.", "authors_str": "Distler O; Bonderman D; Coghlan JG; Denton CP; Gr\u00fcnig E; Khanna D; McLaughlin VV; M\u00fcller-Ladner U; Pope JE; Vonk MC; Di Scala L; Lemarie JC; Perchenet L; Hachulla \u00c9", "doi": "10.1002/art.42791", "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The evidence-based DETECT pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) algorithm is frequently used in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) to help clinicians screen for PAH by using noninvasive data to recommend patient referral to echocardiography and, if applicable, for a diagnostic right-sided heart catheterization. However, the hemodynamic definition of PAH was recently updated in the 2022 European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/European Respiratory Society (ERS) guidelines. The performance of DETECT PAH in identifying patients with a high risk of PAH according to this new definition was assessed.\nMETHODS: In this post hoc analysis of DETECT, which comprised 466 patients with SSc, the performance of the DETECT PAH algorithm in identifying patients with a high risk of PAH as defined in the 2022 ESC/ERS guidelines (mean pulmonary arterial pressure [mPAP] >20\u2009mm Hg, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure [PCWP] \u226415\u2009mm Hg, and pulmonary vascular resistance >2 Wood units) was assessed using summary statistics and was descriptively compared to the known performance of DETECT PAH as defined in 2014, when it was developed (mPAP \u226525\u2009mm Hg and PCWP \u226415\u2009mm Hg).\nRESULTS: The sensitivity of DETECT PAH in identifying patients with a high risk of PAH according to the 2022 ESC/ERS definition was lower (88.2%) compared to the 2014 definition (95.8%).

We aimed to examine if riociguat, a direct stimulator of the nitric oxide receptor soluble guanylate cyclase, causes similar increases in vaso-occlusive events.\nMETHODS: This was a phase 1-2, randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled trial. Eligible patients were 18 years or older, had confirmed sickle cell disease documented by haemoglobin electrophoresis or HPLC fractionation (haemoglobin SS, SC, S\u03b2-thalassemia, SD, or SO-Arab), and stage 1 hypertension or proteinuria. Participants were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive either riociguat or matching placebo via a web-based system to maintain allocation concealment. Both treatments were administered orally starting at 1\u00b70 mg three times a day up to 2\u00b75 mg three times a day (highest tolerated dose) for 12 weeks. Dose escalation by 0\u00b75 mg was considered every 2 weeks if systolic blood pressure was greater than 95 mm Hg and the participant had no signs of hypotension; otherwise, the last dose was maintained. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants who had at least one adjudicated treatment-emergent serious adverse event. The analysis was performed by the intention-to-treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02633397) and was completed.\nFINDINGS: Between April 11, 2017, and Dec 31, 2021, 165 participants were screened and consented to be enrolled into the study. Of these, 130 participants were randomly assigned to either riociguat (n=66) or placebo (n=64). The proportion of participants with at least one treatment-emergent serious adverse event was 22\u00b77% (n=15) in the riociguat group and 31\u00b73% (n=20) in the placebo group (difference -8\u00b75% [90% CI -21\u00b74 to 4\u00b75]; p=0\u00b719). A similar pattern emerged in other key safety outcomes, sickle cell related vaso-occlusive events (16\u00b77 [n=11] vs 21\u00b79% [n=14]; difference -5\u00b72% [-17\u00b72 to 6\u00b75]; p=0\u00b742), mean pain severity (3\u00b718 vs 3\u00b732; adjusted mean difference -0\u00b714 [-0\u00b770 to 0\u00b742]; p=0\u00b769), and pain interference (3\u00b715 vs 3\u00b712; 0\u00b704 [-0\u00b762 to 0\u00b769]; p=0\u00b793) at 12 weeks were similar between groups. Regarding the key clinical efficacy endpoints, participants taking riociguat had a blood pressure of -8\u00b720 mm Hg (-10\u00b748 to -5\u00b791) compared with -1\u00b724 (-3\u00b758 to 1\u00b710) in those taking placebo (-6\u00b796 mm Hg (90% CI -10\u00b722 to -3\u00b769; p<0\u00b7001).\nINTERPRETATION: Riociguat was safe and had a significant haemodynamic effect on systemic blood pressure.
