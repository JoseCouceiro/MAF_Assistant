Emerging evidence shows maternal exercise may improve offspring resistance to disease throughout life. The purpose of this study is to determine if maternal exercise mitigates chronic hypoxic-induced changes in the offspring indicative of high-altitude pulmonary hypertension development.\nMETHODS: Female adult C57BL/6 J mice were randomly allocated to nonexercise or exercise conditions. Exercise consisted of voluntary running wheel exercise for four weeks during the perinatal period. Three days after birth, the pups remained at low altitude (normoxia) or were exposed to hypobaric hypoxia of 450 mmHg to simulate ~4500 m altitude exposure until 8 weeks of age. The study consisted of 4 groups: Hypoxia + Nonexercise pregnancy, Hypoxia + Exercise, or the respective, normoxia conditions (Normoxia + Nonexercise or Normoxia + Exercise). Offspring body size, motor function, right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP), and cardiopulmonary morphology were assessed after 8 weeks in normoxia or hypoxia.\nRESULTS: Both hypoxic groups had smaller body sizes, reduced motor function, increased hematocrit, RVSP, muscularization in medium-sized pulmonary arteries, as well as right ventricular hypertrophy and contractility compared to the normoxic groups (p < 0.05).\nCONCLUSIONS: Chronic hypoxia simulating 4500 m attenuated growth, lowered motor function, and elicited PH development.

PPHN has still a high mortality and morbidity. Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) is the first line vasodilator therapy for PPHN in high income countries. In low-to-middle income countries (LMICs), availability of iNO remains scarce and expensive. The purpose of this scoping review was to evaluate the current existing literature for milrinone therapy in PPHN and to identify the knowledge gaps in milrinone use in infants with PPHN. The available evidence for milrinone remains limited both as monotherapy and as an adjuvant to iNO. The studies were heterogeneous, conducted in different settings, with different populations and more importantly the endpoints of these trials were short-term outcomes such as changes in oxygenation and blood pressure. Large prospective studies investigating long-term outcomes, mortality, and the need for Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) are warranted. Randomized controlled trials with milrinone as monotherapy are needed in LMICs where iNO availability remains limited. IMPACT: Milrinone has a potential role in the management of PPHN both as an adjuvant to iNO as well as a monotherapy. This scoping review identified the problems existing in the published literature on milrinone and the barriers to generalization of these results.

This study aims to investigate whether exosomes derived from ITGB1-modified TCs (ITGB1-Exo) could mitigate PAH.\nMETHODS: We analyzed differentially expressed microRNAs (DEmiRs) in TCs using Affymetrix Genechip miRNA 4.0 arrays. Exosomes isolated from TC culture supernatants were verified through transmission electron microscopy and Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis. The impact of miR-429-3p-enriched exosomes (Exo-ITGB1) on hypoxia-induced pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) was evaluated using CCK-8, transwell assay, and inflammatory factor analysis. A four-week hypoxia-induced mouse model of PAH was constructed, and H&E staining, along with Immunofluorescence staining, were employed to assess PAH progression.\nRESULTS: Forty-five miRNAs exhibited significant differential expression in TCs following ITGB1 knockdown. Mus-miR-429-3p, significantly upregulated in ITGB1-overexpressing TCs and in ITGB1-modified TC-derived exosomes, was selected for further investigation.

Alterations of the insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) system are known to play a role in vascular pathologies and IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs) are important regulators of the bioavailability and function of IGFs. In this study, we show that circulating plasma levels of IGFBP-1, IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-3 are increased in idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) patients compared to healthy individuals. These binding proteins inhibit the IGF-1 induced IGF-1 receptor (IGF1R) phosphorylation and exhibit diverging effects on the IGF-1 induced signaling pathways in human pulmonary arterial cells (i.e. healthy as well as IPAH-hPASMCs, and healthy hPAECs). Furthermore, IGFBPs are differentially expressed in an experimental mouse model of PH. In hypoxic mouse lungs, IGFBP-1 mRNA expression is decreased whereas the mRNA for IGFBP-2 is increased. In contrast to IGFBP-1, IGFBP-2 shows vaso-constrictive properties in the murine pulmonary vasculature.

LC3-II and Beclin-1 were inhibited and their expression was lower after autophagy inhibitor was given, while after administration of autophagy agonists, their expression was higher than that in the EP alone group. Besides, EP attenuated PAH, and right ventricular hypertrophy and pulmonary vascular remodeling were also reversed. EP can reduce PAH and reverse vascular remodeling which is associated with inhibition of autophagy in PAECs based on PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. The results of this study can provide surgical opportunities for patients with severe PAH caused by congenital heart disease in clinical cardiovascular surgery.", "pmid": "38740701", "score": 2, "selected": true}, {"title": "Is There a Role for Calcium Channel Blockers in the Contemporary Treatment Paradigm for Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension?", "authors_str": "Rubin LJ", "doi": "10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.124.069124", "abstract": null, "pmid": "38739700", "score": 2, "selected": true}, {"title": "Sotatercept (Winrevair) for pulmonary arterial hypertension.", "authors_str": "", "doi": "10.58347/tml.2024.1702a", "abstract": null, "pmid": "38696310", "score": 2, "selected": true}, {"title": "Positive Vasoreactivity Testing in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension: Therapeutic Consequences, Treatment Patterns, and Outcomes in the Modern Management Era.", "authors_str": "Gerhardt F; Fiessler E; Olsson KM; Kayser MZ; Kovacs G; Gall H; Ghofrani HA; Badr Eslam R; Lang IM; Benjamin N; Gr\u00fcnig E; Halank M; Lange TJ; Ulrich S; Leuchte H; Held M; Klose H; Ewert R; Wilkens H; Pizarro C; Skowasch D; Wissm\u00fcller M; Hellmich M; Olschewski H; Hoeper MM; Rosenkranz S", "doi": "10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.122.063821", "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Among patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), acute vasoreactivity testing during right heart catheterization may identify acute vasoresponders, for whom treatment with high-dose calcium channel blockers (CCBs) is recommended. However, long-term outcomes in the current era remain largely unknown. We sought to evaluate the implications of acute vasoreactivity response for long-term response to CCBs and other outcomes.\nMETHODS: Patients diagnosed with PAH between January 1999 and December 2018 at 15 pulmonary hypertension centers were included and analyzed retrospectively. In accordance with current guidelines, acute vasoreactivity response was defined by a decrease of mean pulmonary artery pressure by \u226510 mm Hg to reach <40 mm Hg, without a decrease in cardiac output. Long-term response to CCBs was defined as alive with unchanged initial CCB therapy with or without other initial PAH therapy and World Health Organization functional class I/II and/or low European Society of Cardiology/European Respiratory Society risk status at 12 months after initiation of CCBs. Patients were followed for up to 5 years; clinical measures, outcome, and subsequent treatment patterns were captured.\nRESULTS: Of 3702 patients undergoing right heart catheterization for PAH diagnosis, 2051 had idiopathic, heritable, or drug-induced PAH, of whom 1904 (92.8%) underwent acute vasoreactivity testing. A total of 162 patients fulfilled acute vasoreactivity response criteria and received an initial CCB alone (n=123) or in combination with another PAH therapy (n=39). The median follow-up time was 60.0 months (interquartile range, 30.8-60.0), during which overall survival was 86.7%. At 12 months, 53.2% remained on CCB monotherapy, 14.7% on initial CCB plus another initial PAH therapy, and the remaining patients had the CCB withdrawn and/or PAH therapy added. CCB long-term response was found in 54.3% of patients. Five-year survival was 98.5% in long-term responders versus 73.0% in nonresponders. In addition to established vasodilator responder criteria, pulmonary artery compliance at acute vasoreactivity testing, low risk status and NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide) levels at early follow-up correlated with long-term response and predicted survival.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our data display heterogeneity within the group of vasoresponders, with a large subset failing to show a sustained satisfactory clinical response to CCBs. This highlights the necessity for comprehensive reassessment during early follow-up. The use of pulmonary artery compliance in addition to current measures may better identify those likely to have a good long-term response.", "pmid": "38606558", "score": 2, "selected": true}, {"title": "Constructing the Framework for Disease Modification in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension.", "authors_str": "Zamanian RT; Weatherald J; Sweatt AJ; Hemnes A; Rashid M; Psotka MA; Bogaard HJ; de Jesus Perez V", "doi": "10.1164/rccm.202401-0089PP", "abstract": null, "pmid": "38471030", "score": 3, "selected": true}], 26], "macitentan": [[], 2], "selexipag": [[], 1], "ambrisentan": [[], 1], "bosentan": [[], 1], "sotatercept": [[], 0], "riociguat": [[], 1], "portopulmonary hypertension AND pulmonary hypertension": [[], 0], "echocardiography AND pulmonary hypertension": [[], 1], "CPET AND pulmonary hypertension": [[], 2]}
