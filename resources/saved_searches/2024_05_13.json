The tool has excellent psychometric properties and is well used in research and clinical settings. Its factor structure has not been examined, which may help to identity a complimentary approach to using the measure to examine patient functioning. We performed an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) on a data set collected from 263 adults with PH recruited from a community setting. The EFA suggested the emPHasis-10 consists of three underlying latent variables, which based on the loading of items, were termed \"fatigue\" (Items 3, 4, and 5), \"independence\" (Items 7, 8, 9, and 10), and \"breathlessness\" (Items 1, 2, and 6). All factors were found to have good internal consistency. \"Independence\" accounted for most of the variance (29%), followed by \"breathlessness\" (22%) and \"fatigue\" (19%). The CFA looked to confirm the fit of a three-factor model. A higher-order model was found to be the best fit consisting of HRQoL as a superordinate factor, for which the association between this factor and the 10 items was mediated through the three latent factors. Further analyses were performed testing the validity of the latent variables revealing all were significantly correlated with self-reported measures of depression, anxiety, health-anxiety, and dyspnea. Our analyses support the emPHasis-10 as a measure of HRQoL, while also proposing the clinical utility of examining the three emergent factors, which could be used to glean additional insight into the respondent's functioning and inform care.", "pmid": "38736895", "score": 3, "selected": true}, {"title": "Nationwide trends of balloon pulmonary angioplasty and pulmonary thromboendarterectomy for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (2012-2019).", "authors_str": "Vohra AS; Olonoff DA; Ip A; Kirtane AJ; Steinberg Z; Horn E; Krishnan U; Reisman M; Bergman G; Wong SC; Feldman DN; Kim LK; Singh HS", "doi": "10.1002/pul2.12374", "abstract": "Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is a sequela of a pulmonary embolus that occurs in approximately 1%-3% of patients.

First, CANA suppressed increased pulmonary artery pressure, right ventricular hypertrophy, and vascular remodeling in both mouse and rat PH models. Network pharmacology, transcriptomics, and biological results suggested that CANA could ameliorate PH by suppressing excessive oxidative stress and pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell proliferation partially through the activation of PPAR\u03b3. Further studies demonstrated that CANA inhibited phosphorylation of PPAR\u03b3 at Ser225 (a novel serine phosphorylation site in PPAR\u03b3), thereby promoting the nuclear translocation of PPAR\u03b3 and increasing its ability to resist oxidative stress and proliferation. Taken together, our study not only highlighted the potential pharmacological effect of CANA on PH but also revealed that CANA-induced inhibition of PPAR\u03b3 Ser225 phosphorylation increases its capacity to counteract oxidative stress and inhibits proliferation.

The importance of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signalling in the pathogenesis of PAH is demonstrated by human genetic studies. Many PAH risk genes are involved in the BMP signalling pathway and are highly expressed or preferentially act on vascular endothelial cells. Endothelial dysfunction is recognised as an initial trigger for PAH, and endothelial BMP signalling plays a crucial role in the maintenance of endothelial integrity. BMPR2 is the most prevalent PAH gene, found in over 80% of heritable cases. As BMPRII protein is the major type II receptor for a large family of BMP ligands and expressed ubiquitously in many tissues, dysregulated BMP signalling in other cells may also contribute to PAH pathobiology. Sotatercept, which contains the extracellular domain of another transforming growth factor-\u03b2 family type II receptor ActRIIA fused to immunoglobin Fc domain, was recently approved by the FDA as a treatment for PAH. Neither its target cells nor its mechanism of action is fully understood. This review will revisit BMPRII function and its extracellular regulation, summarise how dysregulated BMP signalling in endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells may contribute to PAH pathogenesis, and discuss how novel therapeutics targeting the extracellular regulation of BMP signalling, such as BMP9 and Sotatercept, can be related to restoring BMPRII function.", "pmid": "38716930", "score": 2, "selected": true}, {"title": "Ethanol-induced lung and cardiac right ventricular inflammation and remodeling underlie progression to pulmonary arterial hypertension.", "authors_str": "Donovan MK; Abdel-Rahman AA", "doi": "10.1111/acer.15341", "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Current research on ethanol-induced cardiovascular anomalies has focused on left ventricular (LV) function and blood pressure. To extend this area of research, we sought to determine whether ethanol-induced alterations in the structure and function of the right cardiac ventricle (RV) and pulmonary artery (PA) lead to pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).\nMETHODS: Two groups of male Sprague-Dawley rats received a balanced liquid diet containing 5% ethanol (w/v) or a pair-fed isocaloric liquid diet for 8\u2009weeks. Weekly echocardiography was conducted to evaluate cardiopulmonary function, and lung and RV tissues were collected for ex\u00a0vivo histological and molecular studies.\nRESULTS: The ethanol-treated rats exhibited: (1) Elevated mean pulmonary arterial pressure and decreased pulmonary artery acceleration time/ejection time; (2) Pulmonary vascular remodeling comprising intrapulmonary artery medial layer thickening; and (3) RV hypertrophy along with increased RV/LV\u2009+\u2009septum, RV diameter, RV cardiomyocyte cross-sectional area, and LV mass/body weight ratio. These responses were associated with increased lung and RV pro-inflammatory markers, endothelin-1 (ET-1), TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6 levels and higher ET-1,\u00a0ET-1 type A/B receptor ratio, and downregulation of the cytoprotective protein, bone morphogenetic protein receptor 2 (BMPR2), in the lungs.\nCONCLUSION: These findings show that moderate ethanol-induced cardiopulmonary changes underlie progression to PAH via an upregulated proinflammatory ET1-TNF\u03b1-IL6 pathway and suppression of the anti-inflammatory BMPR2.", "pmid": "38710650", "score": 3, "selected": true}, {"title": "Sotatercept (Winrevair) for pulmonary arterial hypertension.", "authors_str": "", "doi": "10.58347/tml.2024.1702a", "abstract": null, "pmid": "38696310", "score": 2, "selected": true}, {"title": "Spermidine attenuates monocrotaline-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension in rats by inhibiting purine metabolism and polyamine synthesis-associated vascular remodeling.", "authors_str": "Chen YJ; Li HF; Zhao FR; Yu M; Pan SY; Sun WZ; Yin YY; Zhu TT", "doi": "10.1016/j.intimp.2024.111946", "abstract": "Ensuring the homeostatic integrity of pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAECs) is essential for combatting pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), as it equips the cells to withstand microenvironmental challenges. Spermidine (SPD), a potent facilitator of autophagy, has been identified as a significant contributor to PAECs function and survival. Despite SPD's observed benefits, a comprehensive understanding of its protective mechanisms has remained elusive. Through an integrated approach combining metabolomics and molecular biology, this study uncovers the molecular pathways employed by SPD in mitigating PAH induced by monocrotaline (MCT) in a Sprague-Dawley rat model. The study demonstrates that SPD administration (5\u00a0mg/kg/day) significantly corrects right ventricular impairment and pathological changes in pulmonary tissues following MCT exposure (60\u00a0mg/kg). Metabolomic profiling identified a purine metabolism disorder in MCT-treated rats, which SPD effectively normalized, conferring a protective effect against PAH progression. Subsequent in vitro analysis showed that SPD (0.8\u00a0mM) reduces oxidative stress and apoptosis in PAECs challenged with Dehydromonocrotaline (MCTP, 50\u00a0\u03bcM), likely by downregulating purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) and modulating polyamine biosynthesis through alterations in S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AMD1) expression and the subsequent production of decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine (dcSAM). These findings advocate SPD's dual inhibitory effect on PNP and AMD1 as a novel strategy to conserve cellular ATP and alleviate oxidative injuries, thus providing a foundation for SPD's potential therapeutic application in PAH treatment.", "pmid": "38552292", "score": 2, "selected": true}], 16], "macitentan": [[], 1], "selexipag": [[], 1], "ambrisentan": [[], 1], "bosentan": [[{"title": "Preparation of orodispersible tablets of bosentan using xylitol and menthol as dissolution enhancers.", "authors_str": "Sakr RM; Abdelaziz AES; Mazyed EA; El Maghraby GM", "doi": "10.1038/s41598-024-60494-9", "abstract": "Bosentan is a drug used to treat pulmonary hypertension via dual endothelial receptor antagonism. Bosentan has a restricted oral bioavailability, a problem that's mostly due to poor solubility and hepatic metabolism. It is extensively used for the elderly and children who require a friendly dosage form like orodispersible tablets. So, the goal of this research work was to hasten the dissolution rate of bosentan to produce an orodispersible tablet with immediate drug release. Bosentan was exposed to ethanol-assisted kneading with a rise of xylitol or menthol concentrations (1:1 and 1:2 molar ratio of bosentan with excipient). In addition to observing the dissolution behavior, the resulting dry products were investigated using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), differential thermal analysis (DTA), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The FTIR reflected possible hydrogen bonding with xylitol and menthol. DSC studies reflected a reduction in the enthalpy and Tm. These results with XRD data reflected partial co-amorphization in the case of xylitol and eutaxia in the case of menthol. These modifications were related to an accelerated dissolving rate. The developed systems were fabricated as orodispersible tablets which exhibited immediate release of bosentan. Thus, the current study offered simple co-processing for the preparation of orodispersible bosentan tablets.", "pmid": "38724608", "score": 2, "selected": true}], 2], "sotatercept": [[], 1], "riociguat": [[], 2], "portopulmonary hypertension AND pulmonary hypertension": [[], 0], "echocardiography AND pulmonary hypertension": [[], 7], "CPET AND pulmonary hypertension": [[], 1]}
