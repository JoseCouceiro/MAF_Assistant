Over the last decade, percutaneous closure is increasingly undertaken, with results similar to cardiac surgery. We present a case of ST-elevated anterior AMI, complicated by apical PIVSD successfully treated with transcatheter closure.\nCASE REPORT: An 83-year-old man was hospitalized for chest pain occurred 18 hours before, during the night time. He was an active smoker. Clinical examination revealed normal heart sounds and pulmonary bibasilar crackles. ST-segment elevation with deep T waves inversion in anterior leads were detected on the electrocardiogram. A mildly-reduced ejection fraction (40%) was found by transthoracic echocardiogram. The patient underwent emergency coronary angiography, which revealed a subocclusive stenosis of the mid left anterior descending artery with a TIMI 2 flow, treated by balloon angioplasty and drug-eluting stent. Four days after revascularization, the patient developed an acute deterioration with signs of decompensated heart failure and a new holosystolic murmur with large irradiation. Inotropic agents' administration was required to maintain a precarious hemodynamic condition. A bedside Echo revealed an apical VSD, measuring 15 \u00d7 10 mm, with left-to-right shunting, and pulmonary hypertension. The patient was scheduled for transcatheter PIVSD closure. The procedure was performed under fluoroscopic guide. Two vascular access sites were placed, femoral arterial and right internal jugular vein. Through the right internal jugular vein, a 24-mm Amplatzer atrial septal occluder on a 9 French Amplatzer TREVISIO\u2122 intravascular delivery system was advanced via right ventricle into the PIVSD. Contrast fluoroscopy was used to assess apposition and the degree of shunt reduction before release. Echocardiographic evaluation performed 48 hours later confirmed a correct apposition of the device with insignificant residual shunt. At 6 months follow-up, he was asymptomatic, with unchanged prosthetic findings.\nCONCLUSION: Percutaneous closure has been emerged as a valid cost-effective alternative to surgery and should be advised. However, debate remains on the optimal preprocedural optimization, timing of repair and modality of treatment.", "pmid": "38262253", "score": 2, "selected": true}], "Cardiopulmonary exercise test AND pulmonary hypertension": [], "Systemic sclerosis AND pulmonary hypertension": [], "Connective tissue disease AND pulmonary hypertension": [], "pulmonary hypertension": [{"title": "Serial tissue Doppler imaging in the evaluation of bronchopulmonary dysplasia-associated pulmonary hypertension among extremely preterm infants: a prospective observational study.", "authors_str": "Gopagondanahalli KR; Abdul Haium AA; Vora SJ; Sundararaghavan S; Ng WD; Choo TLJ; Ang WL; Binte Mohamad Taib NQ; Wijedasa NHY; Rajadurai VS; Yeo KT; Tan TH", "doi": "10.3389/fped.2024.1349175", "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To evaluate serial tissue Doppler cardiac imaging (TDI) in the evolution of bronchopulmonary dysplasia-associated pulmonary hypertension (BPD-PH) among extremely preterm infants.\nDESIGN: Prospective observational study.\nSETTING: Single-center, tertiary-level neonatal intensive care unit.\nPATIENTS: Infant born <28 weeks gestation.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Utility of TDI in the early diagnosis and prediction of BPD-PH and optimal timing for screening of BPD-PH.\nRESULTS: A total of 79 infants were included.

NO is a cellular signaling molecule that induces smooth muscle relaxation in the mammalian vasculature. Inhaled NO has the unique ability to exert its vasodilatory effects in the pulmonary vasculature without any hypotensive side-effects in the systemic circulation. In patients undergoing cardiac surgery, NO has been reported in numerous studies to exert beneficial effects on acutely lowering pulmonary artery pressure and reversing right ventricular dysfunction and/or failure. Yet, various investigations failed to demonstrate significant differences in long-term clinical outcomes. The authors, serving as an advisory board of international experts in the field of inhaled NO within pediatric and adult cardiac surgery, will discuss how the existing scientific evidence can be further improved. We will summarize the basic mechanisms underlying the clinical applications of inhaled NO and how this translates into the mandate for inhaled NO in cardiac surgery. We will move on to the popular use of inhaled NO and will talk about the evidence base of the use of this selective pulmonary vasodilator. This review will elucidate what kind of clinical and biological barriers and gaps in knowledge need to be solved and how this has impacted in the development of clinical trials. The authors will elaborate on how the optimization of inhaled NO therapy, the development of biomarkers to identify the target population and the definition of response can improve the design of future large clinical trials. We will explain why it is mandatory to gain an international consensus for the state of the art of NO therapy far beyond this expert advisory board by including the different major players in the field, such as the different medical societies and the pharma industry to improve our understanding of the real-life effects of inhaled NO in large scale observational studies. The design for future innovative randomized controlled trials on inhaled NO therapy in cardiac surgery, adequately powered and based on enhanced biological phenotyping, will be crucial to eventually provide scientific evidence of its clinical efficacy beyond its beneficial hemodynamic properties.", "pmid": "38646153", "score": 3, "selected": true}, {"title": "Deep learning to assess right ventricular ejection fraction from two-dimensional echocardiograms in precapillary pulmonary hypertension.", "authors_str": "Murayama M; Sugimori H; Yoshimura T; Kaga S; Shima H; Tsuneta S; Mukai A; Nagai Y; Yokoyama S; Nishino H; Nakamura J; Sato T; Tsujino I", "doi": "10.1111/echo.15812", "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Precapillary pulmonary hypertension (PH) is characterized by a sustained increase in right ventricular (RV) afterload, impairing systolic function.

In addition, HMGB2 promoted PASMC proliferation and the development of PH by RAGE (receptor for advanced glycation end products)/FAK (focal adhesion kinase)-mediated Hippo/YAP (yes-associated protein) signaling suppression. Serum HMGB2 levels were significantly increased in patients with PA hypertension, and they correlated with disease severity, predicting worse survival.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that targeting HMGB2 might be a novel therapeutic strategy for treating PH.

The posttranslational modification (eg, phosphorylation and ubiquitination) of TGF-\u03b2 family receptors, including BMPR2 (bone morphogenetic protein type 2 receptor)/ALK2 (activin receptor-like kinase-2) and TGF-\u03b2R2/R1, and receptor-regulated (R) Smads significantly affects their activity and thus regulates the target cell fate. BRCC3 modifies the activity and stability of its substrate proteins through K63-dependent deubiquitination. By modulating the posttranslational modifications of the BMP/TGF-\u03b2-PPAR\u03b3 pathway, BRCC3 may play a role in pulmonary vascular remodeling, hence the pathogenesis of PAH.\nMETHODS: Bioinformatic analyses were used to explore the mechanism of BRCC3 deubiquitinates ALK2. Cultured pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs), mouse models, and specimens from patients with idiopathic PAH were used to investigate the rebalance between BMP and TGF-\u03b2 signaling in regulating ALK2 phosphorylation and ubiquitination in the context of pulmonary hypertension.\nRESULTS: BRCC3 was significantly downregulated in PASMCs from patients with PAH and animals with experimental pulmonary hypertension. BRCC3, by de-ubiquitinating ALK2 at Lys-472 and Lys-475, activated receptor-regulated Smad1/5/9 (Smad1/5/9), which resulted in transcriptional activation of BMP-regulated PPAR\u03b3, p53, and Id1. Overexpression of BRCC3 also attenuated TGF-\u03b2 signaling by downregulating TGF-\u03b2 expression and inhibiting phosphorylation of Smad3. Experiments in vitro indicated that overexpression of BRCC3 or the de-ubiquitin-mimetic ALK2-K472/475R attenuated PASMC proliferation and migration and enhanced PASMC apoptosis. In SM22\u03b1-BRCC3-Tg mice, pulmonary hypertension was ameliorated because of activation of the ALK2-Smad1/5-PPAR\u03b3 axis in PASMCs. In contrast, \nCONCLUSIONS: These results suggest a pivotal role of BRCC3 in sustaining pulmonary vascular homeostasis by maintaining the integrity of the BMP signaling (ie, the ALK2-Smad1/5-PPAR\u03b3 axis) while suppressing TGF-\u03b2 signaling in PASMCs.

Cannabidiol (CBD) has many beneficial properties including anti-inflammatory and reduces RV systolic pressure and RV hypertrophy in monocrotaline (MCT)-induced PH in rats. Thus, it suggests that CBD may have the potential to limit CH development secondary to RV failure. The present study aimed to determine whether chronic administration of CBD can inhibit the CH secondary to RV hypertrophy associated with MCT-induced PH.\nMETHODS: The experiments involved rats with and without MCT-induced PH. CBD (10\u00a0mg/kg) or its vehicle was administered once daily for 3 weeks after MCT injection (60\u00a0mg/kg).\nRESULTS: Monocrotaline administration increased the liver/body weight ratio.

Multivariate analysis confirmed severe TR, WHO functional class III/IV, and right ventricular stroke work index as independent predictors of mortality.\nCONCLUSION: Severe TR significantly predicts increased mortality in PH patients, underscoring its importance in patient management. These findings advocate for early detection and comprehensive management of TR, integrating its assessment into routine PH care to potentially enhance patient outcomes.", "pmid": "38262505", "score": 2, "selected": true}, {"title": "Determinants of pulmonary hypertension in patients with end-stage kidney disease and arteriovenous access.", "authors_str": "Warner ED; Corsi DR; Jimenez D; Bierowski M; Brailovsky Y; Oliveros E; Alvarez RJ; Kumar V; Bhardwaj A; Rajapreyar IN", "doi": "10.1016/j.cpcardiol.2024.102406", "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pulmonary Hypertension (PH) is a sequela of arteriovenous (AV) fistulas (AVF) or AV grafts (AVG) in patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) due to the creation of shunt physiology and increased pulmonary blood flow. PH has been consistently associated with increased mortality but there is a paucity of data regarding management.\nRESEARCH QUESTION: The objective of this study was to identify risk factors and outcomes in patients who develop PH after AVF or AVG creation for hemodialysis access.\nMETHODS: Using the United States Renal Data System, we identified all patients over age 18 initiated on dialysis from 2012-2019 who did not receive renal transplant. We identified a) the predictors of PH in patients with ESKD on hemodialysis; b) the independent mortality risk associated with development of PH.\nRESULTS: We identified 478,896 patients initiated on dialysis from 2012-2019 of whom 27,787 (5.8 %) had a diagnosis of PH. The median age was 65 (IQR: 55-74) years and 59.1 % were male. Reduced ejection fraction, any congestive heart failure, obstructive sleep apnea, and female sex were the strongest predictors of PH diagnosis. Both AVG and AVF were also associated with an increased rate of PH diagnosis compared to catheter-based dialysis (p < 0.001). PH portended a poor prognosis and was associated with significantly increased mortality (p < 0.001).\nCONCLUSIONS: Patients with AVF or AVG should be screened using echocardiography prior to creation and monitored with serial echocardiography for the development of PH, and if present, considered for revision of the AVA.

In the study population, pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with congenital heart disease (PAH-CHD) was the most common type of PH (n\u00a0=\u00a034, 59%), followed by idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) (n\u00a0=\u00a019, 33%). Typical atrial flutter was the most common type of atrial flutter (n\u00a0=\u00a050, 86.2%). Sinus rhythm was restored in 53 (91.4%) patients during RFCA. After a mean follow-up of 33.8\u00a0months, AFL recurred in a total of 22 patients. Nine of them underwent repeat RFCA, and the site of the repeat ablation was not exactly the same as the first. At a median follow-up of 34.6\u00a0months after the last ablation, none of the patients who underwent repeat RFCA experienced AFL recurrence, and all of these patients survived. There were no procedure-related complications during hospitalization or follow-up. Univariate Cox regression analysis suggested that AFL recurrence after the last ablation was not associated with all-cause mortality.

Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis revealed that the area under the curve (AUC) of PASP for predicting all-cause mortality was 0.708. There was no significant difference in the Kaplan-Meier curves for all-cause mortality between patients with AFL recurrence after the last ablation and those without recurrence (P\u00a0=\u00a00.851). Patients with higher PASP (\u2265110\u00a0mmHg) and IPAH showed the lower survival rate in Kaplan-Meier curves.\nCONCLUSION: Repeat ablation was safe and feasible in patients with recurrent AFL and can maintain sinus rhythm.

The aim of this study was to investigate and compare serum levels of IL-6 in children with PAH and healthy matched controls, and correlate between IL-6 and degree of PAH, as well as mortality. IL-6 was measured by ELISA in serum samples in 40 children with PAH (age 1-12\u00a0years) and 40 age and sex-matched healthy controls.

Non-target UHPLC-Orbitrap mass spectrometry analysis identified 251 HOPs that were in greater abundance in light-exposed samples than dark controls. Oxidized polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were also detected, including phenanthrene quinone, anthraquinone, hydroxyanthraquinone, and 9-fluoreneone. The composition of HOPs were consistent with photo-products of alkylated two to four ring PAHs, primarily compounds between 1 and 3 aromatic rings and 1-3 oxygens. The HOP mixture formed during photochemical weathering of Cook Inlet crude oil induced greater AhR activity than parent petroleum products solubilized in dark controls, indicating that HOPs, as a complex mixture, may contribute to petroleum toxicity more than the parent petroleum compounds. These non-targeted approaches provide the most comprehensive analysis of hydrocarbon oxidation products to date, highlighting the diversity of the complex mixture resulting from the photooxidation of crude oil and the limitations of targeted analyses for adequately monitoring HOPs in the environment. Taken together, these data identify a critical \"blind spot\" in environmental monitoring and spill clean-up strategies as there is a diverse pool of HOPs that may negatively impact human and ecosystem health.", "pmid": "38579945", "score": 3, "selected": true}, {"title": "Sourcing aliphatic and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in Jinga shrimp (Metapenaeus affinis) muscle tissues and surface sediments (study case: Northwest Persian Gulf).", "authors_str": "Monjezi SD; Bakhtiyari AR; Alavi-Yeganeh MS", "doi": "10.1007/s11356-024-32738-8", "abstract": "This study addresses the sources of aliphatic hydrocarbons (AHs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the surface sediments of the northwestern Persian Gulf and the muscle tissues of Jinga shrimp (Metapenaeus affinis), a commercially important aquatic species.

The concentrations of 10\u00a0PAH metabolites in the urine of firefighters were measured immediately after, and two weeks post their engagement in extinguishing a large tire factory fire. The levels of OH-PAHs in urine samples immediately after fire suppression were elevated by a factor of 1.01-1.84 compared to urine samples from non-exposed period. The median concentration of total PAH metabolites (OH-PAHs) was higher in urine samples immediately after fire suppression (5910\u00a0ng/g creatinine) than in urine samples from non-exposed periods (5020\u00a0ng/g creatinine). However, the \u2211OH-PAH levels in firefighters' urine were related to personal habits such as smoking. The concentrations of all individual OH-PAHs in the urine samples of nonsmokers exhibited a substantial increase, ranging from 1.37 to 2.3 times, clearly demonstrating that firefighting activities were a substantial source of PAH exposure. The calculated values associated with the health risks stemming from exposure to PAHs, including carcinogenic risk, total estimated daily intake (TEDI), and hazard quotients/index (HQs/HI), all fell within acceptable limits, indicating negligible risk. However, the HQ/HI values and TEDI for individual and total PAH exposures, except those for naphthalene, were 1.36-2.00 times higher in firefighters' samples taken after firefighting operations compared to those during regular duty.

However, historically contaminated soils, such as former coking plant soils, usually induce a limited toxic impact, due to the \"aging\" phenomenon which is the result of several processes causing a reduction of PAC availability over time. For a better understanding of these behaviors, this study aimed to compare the toxic responses of terrestrial organisms exposed to aged contaminated soils and their counterparts submitted to a moderate heating process applied to increase PAC availability. Two aged \"raw\" soils (limited PAC availability) were selected for their representativeness of former industrial soils in terms of PAC contamination. These soils were submitted either to moderate heating (expected PAC availability increase) or solvent-extraction (expected PAC removal). Physico-chemical parameters, contamination levels and availability were determined for these three soil modalities. Additionally, standardized limit bioassays on plants and earthworms were performed to assess soil ecotoxicity. The findings demonstrated that historically contaminated soils exposed to moderate heating induced the highest ecotoxic responses from terrestrial organisms. Heating increased PAC (bio)availability, without modifying any other soil physico-chemical properties. These results pointed out the importance of considering the contamination availability parameter in risk evaluation and also provide a possible tool for protective long-term risk assessment.", "pmid": "38330651", "score": 3, "selected": true}]}
