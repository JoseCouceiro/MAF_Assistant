Mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices, particularly left ventricular assist devices (LVADs), have emerged as a therapeutic option to manage PH in this patient population. This systematic review aims to evaluate the effectiveness of MCS devices in reversing fixed pulmonary hypertension in heart transplant candidates.\nMETHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted across multiple databases, including PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, to identify studies that evaluated the effectiveness of MCS devices in reversing fixed pulmonary hypertension in heart transplant candidates. Data on pulmonary vascular resistance, PH reversal, heart transplant eligibility, and post-transplant outcomes were extracted and synthesized.\nRESULTS: The review included studies that demonstrated the potential of MCS devices, especially LVADs, to significantly reduce pulmonary vascular resistance and reverse fixed pulmonary hypertension in heart transplant candidates. These findings suggest that MCS devices can improve transplant eligibility and may positively impact post-transplant survival rates. However, the literature also indicates a need for further comparative studies to optimize MCS device selection and treatment protocols.\nCONCLUSION: MCS devices, particularly LVADs, play a crucial role in the management of fixed pulmonary hypertension in heart transplant candidates, improving their eligibility for transplantation and potentially enhancing post-transplant outcomes.

At present, the definitive pathology of PAH has not been elucidated and its effective treatment remains lacking. Despite PAHs having multiple pathogeneses, the cancer-like characteristics of cells have been considered the main reason for PAH progression.\nRECENT FINDINGS: p53 protein, an important tumor suppressor, regulates a multitude of gene expressions to maintain normal cellular functions and suppress the progression of malignant tumors. Recently, p53 has been found to exert multiple biological effects on cardiovascular diseases. Since PAH shares similar metabolic features with cancer cells, the regulatory roles of p53 in PAH are mainly the induction of cell cycle, inhibition of cell proliferation, and promotion of apoptosis.\nSUMMARY: This paper summarized the advanced findings on the molecular mechanisms and regulatory functions of p53 in PAH, aiming to reveal the potential therapeutic targets for PAH.", "pmid": "38643536", "score": 2, "selected": true}, {"title": "Gaps in evidence in the management of patients with intermediate-risk pulmonary arterial hypertension: Considerations following the ESC/ERS 2022 guidelines.", "authors_str": "D'Alto M; Badagliacca R; Air\u00f2 E; Ameri P; Argiento P; Garascia A; Lombardi CM; Mul\u00e8 M; Raineri C; Scelsi L; Vizza CD; Ghio S", "doi": "10.1016/j.vph.2024.107374", "abstract": "A comprehensive evaluation of risk, using multiple indices, is necessary to provide reliable prognostic information and guide therapy in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).

ATP13A3 is implicated in polyamine transport but its function has not been fully elucidated. Here, we sought to determine the biological function of ATP13A3 in vascular endothelial cells and how PAH-associated variants may contribute to disease pathogenesis.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We studied the impact of ATP13A3 deficiency and overexpression in endothelial cell (EC) models (human pulmonary ECs, blood outgrowth ECs (BOECs) and HMEC-1 cells), including a PAH patient-derived BOEC line harbouring an ATP13A3 variant (LK726X). We also generated mice harbouring an Atp13a3 variant analogous to a human disease-associated variant to establish whether these mice develop PAH.ATP13A3 localised to the recycling endosomes of human ECs. Knockdown of ATP13A3 in ECs generally reduced the basal polyamine content and altered the expression of enzymes involved in polyamine metabolism. Conversely, overexpression of wild-type ATP13A3 increased polyamine uptake. Functionally, loss of ATP13A3 was associated with reduced EC proliferation, increased apoptosis in serum starvation and increased monolayer permeability to thrombin. Assessment of five PAH-associated missense ATP13A3 variants (L675V, M850I, V855M, R858H, L956P) confirmed loss-of-function phenotypes represented by impaired polyamine transport and dysregulated EC function. Furthermore, mice carrying a heterozygous germ-line Atp13a3 frameshift variant representing a human variant spontaneously developed a PAH phenotype, with increased pulmonary pressures, right ventricular remodelling and muscularisation of pulmonary vessels.\nCONCLUSION: We identify ATP13A3 as a polyamine transporter controlling polyamine homeostasis in ECs, deficiency of which leads to EC dysfunction and predisposes to PAH.

Pulmonary vascular remodeling is primarily caused by the excessive proliferation and migration of pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs), which are facilitated by perivascular inflammatory cells including macrophages. Corosolic acid (CRA) is a natural pentacyclic triterpenoid that exerts anti-inflammatory effects. In the present study, the effects of CRA on the viability of macrophages were examined using monocrotaline (MCT)-induced PAH rats and human monocyte-derived macrophages. Although we previously reported that CRA inhibited signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling and ameliorated pulmonary vascular remodeling in PAH, the inhibitory mechanism remains unclear. Therefore, the underlying mechanisms were investigated using PASMCs from idiopathic PAH (IPAH) patients. In MCT-PAH rats, CRA inhibited the accumulation of macrophages around remodeled pulmonary arteries. CRA reduced the viability of human monocyte-derived macrophages. In IPAH-PASMCs, CRA attenuated cell proliferation and migration facilitated by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB released from macrophages and PASMCs. CRA also downregulated the expression of PDGF receptor \u03b2 and its signaling pathways, STAT3 and nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB). In addition, CRA attenuated the phosphorylation of PDGF receptor \u03b2 and STAT3 following the PDGF-BB simulation. The expression and phosphorylation levels of PDGF receptor \u03b2 after the PDGF-BB stimulation were reduced by the small interfering RNA knockdown of NF-\u03baB, but not STAT3, in IPAH-PASMCs.

Furthermore, the study illustrates that the incorporation of biochar and surfactants, along with chelating agents like EDTA, can significantly enhance treatment efficiency. However, the research acknowledges that varying environmental conditions necessitate site-specific adaptations in remediation strategies. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) findings indicate that while high-energy methods like Steam Enhanced Extraction and Thermal Resistivity - ERH are effective, they also entail substantial environmental and financial costs. Conversely, Natural Attenuation, despite being a low-impact and cost-effective option, may require prolonged monitoring. The study advocates for an integrative approach to soil remediation, one that harmoniously balances environmental sustainability, cost-effectiveness, and the specific requirements of contaminated sites. It underscores the necessity of a holistic strategy that combines various remediation methods, tailored to meet both regulatory compliance and the long-term sustainability of decontamination efforts.", "pmid": "38402679", "score": 3, "selected": true}, {"title": "Drivers distinguishing of PAHs heterogeneity in surface soil of China using deep learning coupled with geo-statistical approach.", "authors_str": "Wang W; Chen S; Chen L; Wang L; Chao Y; Shi Z; Lin D; Yang K", "doi": "10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.133840", "abstract": "Although numerous studies have reported the influencing factors of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in surface soil from source, process or soil perspectives, the mechanism of PAHs heterogeneity in surface soil are still not well understood. In this study, the effects of 16 PAHs in surface soil of China sampled between 2003 and 2020 with their 17 \"source-process-sink\" factors at 1\u00a0km resolution (N\u00a0=\u00a0660)) were explored using deep learning (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) to mine key information from complex dataset under the optimized parameters (i.e., learning rate = 0.05, maximum depth = 5, sub-sample = 0.8). It was observed that top five factors of 16 PAH had the largest cumulative contribution (i.e., from 84.8% to 98.1%) on their soil concentrations. PAH emission was the predominant driver, and its effect on soil PAH increases with increasing logK", "pmid": "38394897", "score": 2, "selected": true}]}
