Metabolic dysfunction has been linked to the pathogenesis and prognosis of PH through various studies, with emerging metabolic agents offering a potential avenue for improving patient outcomes. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT-2i), a novel hypoglycemic agent, could ameliorate metabolic dysfunction and exert cardioprotective effects. Recent small-scale studies suggest SGLT-2i treatment may improve pulmonary artery pressure in patients with PH-LHD, and the PAH animal model shows that SGLT-2i can reduce pulmonary vascular remodeling and prevent progression in PAH, suggesting potential benefits for patients with PH-LHD and perhaps PAH.

Specifically, the increased intracardiac pressure and right ventricular hypertrophy associated with PH would seemingly increase the intrapericardial pressure threshold at which the right-sided chambers collapse. In this systematic review, we examined the impact of PH on the incidence, in-hospital and long-term mortality, and echocardiographic findings of patients with cardiac tamponade. Using the PRISMA guideline, a systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Academic Search Premier, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane Database for studies investigating PH and cardiac tamponade. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to analyze the quality of returned studies. Primary outcomes included the incidence of cardiac tamponade, as well as in-hospital and long-term mortality rates. Secondary outcomes were the presence or absence of echocardiographic findings of cardiac tamponade in patients with PH. Forty-three studies (9 cohort studies and 34 case reports) with 1054 patients were included. The incidence of cardiac tamponade was significantly higher in patients with PH compared to those without PH, 2.0% (95% CI 1.2-3.2%) vs. 0.05% (95% CI 0.05-0.05%), p\u2009<\u20090.0001, OR 40.76 (95% CI 24.8-66.9).

Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) was performed. Finally, sensitivity analyses including Cochran's Q test, MR-Egger intercept test, leave-one-out analyses, and funnel plot was performed.\nRESULTS: PAH had no causal relationship with depression, anxiety, and cognitive performance. At the global level, PAH was not associated with SA or TH of the brain cortex; at the functional regional level, PAH increased TH of insula (P\u00a0=\u00a00.015), pars triangularis (P\u00a0=\u00a00.037) and pars opercularis (P\u00a0=\u00a00.010) without global weighted.

Fifty seven (20%) had PAH-LHD according to the AMBITION definition. Compared with no-LHD ones, they were older, had higher BMI, more cardiovascular comorbidities, higher E/e' ratio and left atrial area, but lower BNP concentrations and better right ventricular function and pulmonary hemodynamics. Survival was comparable between PAH-LHD and no-LHD patients, although the former were less commonly treated with dual PAH therapy. Both COMPERA and COMPERA 2.0 discriminated all-cause mortality risk of PAH-LHD at follow-up, but not at baseline. Risk profile significantly improved during follow-up only when assessed by COMPERA 2.0. At multivariable analysis with low-risk status as reference, intermediate-high and high-risk, but not LHD phenotype, were associated with higher hazard of all-cause mortality. Results were comparable in secondary analyses including patients in the last 10\u00a0years and atrial fibrillation and echocardiographic abnormalities as additional criteria for PAH-LHD.\nCONCLUSIONS: In real life, PAH-LHD patients are frequent, have less severe disease and are less likely treated with PAH drug combinations than no-LHD.

However, the advent of modern PAH-specific drugs may undermine the role of vasoreactivity tests and CCB treatment. We aimed to clarify the effect of acute vasoreactivity testing and CCB on patients with IPAH receiving PAH-specific treatment.\nMETHODS: We retrospectively investigated consecutive patients with IPAH (n\u00a0=\u00a0136) diagnosed between 2000 and 2020 and collected data from patients who underwent acute vasoreactivity testing using inhaled nitric oxide (NO). The effects of vasoreactivity testing and CCB therapy were reviewed.

Eight patients (12%), including three patients (4.4%) receiving PAH-specific therapy, presented acute responses at vasoreactivity testing. They received high-dose CCB therapy (CCB monotherapy for five patients [7.5%] and CCB therapy and PAH-specific therapy for three patients [4.4%]).

The cohort had a mean age of 57.6 years, with 56.9% males, and was stratified by NYHA functional class II-IV. Outcomes assessed included mortality, complication rates, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP), with statistical analysis performed using t-tests and chi-square tests for continuous and categorical data, respectively.\nRESULTS: Postoperative outcomes varied significantly with age, NYHA class, and PASP grade. Patients aged \u226460 exhibited an average PASP reduction of 44.46% in the male group and 44.44% in the female group and an LVEF improvement of 5.28% in the male group and 5.80% in the female group.

However, long-term outcomes in the current era remain largely unknown. We sought to evaluate the implications of acute vasoreactivity response for long-term response to CCBs and other outcomes.\nMETHODS: Patients diagnosed with PAH between January 1999 and December 2018 at 15 pulmonary hypertension centers were included and analyzed retrospectively. In accordance with current guidelines, acute vasoreactivity response was defined by a decrease of mean pulmonary artery pressure by \u226510 mm Hg to reach <40 mm Hg, without a decrease in cardiac output. Long-term response to CCBs was defined as alive with unchanged initial CCB therapy with or without other initial PAH therapy and World Health Organization functional classification I/II or low European Society of Cardiology/European Respiratory Society risk status at 12 months after initiation of CCBs. Patients were followed for up to 5 years; clinical measures, outcome, and subsequent treatment patterns were captured.\nRESULTS: Of 3702 patients undergoing right heart catheterization for PAH diagnosis, 2051 had idiopathic, hereditary, or drug-induced PAH, of whom 1904 (92.8%) underwent acute vasoreactivity testing. A total of 162 patients fulfilled acute vasoreactivity response criteria and received an initial CCB alone (n=123) or in combination with another PAH therapy (n=39). The median follow-up time was 60.0 months (interquartile range, 30.8-60.0), during which overall survival was 86.7%. At 12 months, 53.2% remained on CCB monotherapy, 14.7% on initial CCB plus another initial PAH therapy, and the remaining patients had the CCB withdrawn or PAH therapy added. CCB long-term response was found in 54.3% of patients. Five-year survival was 98.5% in long-term responders versus 73.0% in nonresponders. In addition to established vasodilator responder criteria, pulmonary artery compliance at acute vasoreactivity testing, low risk status and NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide) levels at early follow-up correlated with long-term response and predicted survival.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our data display heterogeneity within the group of vasoresponders, with a large subset failing to show a sustained satisfactory clinical response to CCBs.

Exos are released into the extracellular environment by the fusion of intracellular multivesicular bodies with the cell membrane, and they play an important role in cellular communication.
