Pulmonary interstitial macrophages (IMs) play pivotal roles in immune and vascular dysfunction, leading to inflammation, abnormal remodeling, and fibrosis in PH. However, IMs' response to hypoxia and their role in PH progression remain largely unknown. We utilized a murine model of hypoxia-induced PH to investigate the repertoire and functional profiles of IMs in response to acute and prolonged hypoxia, aiming to elucidate their contributions to PH development.\nMETHODS: We conducted single-cell transcriptomic analyses to characterize the repertoire and functional profiles of murine pulmonary IMs following exposure to hypobaric hypoxia for varying durations (0, 1, 3, 7, and 21 days). Hallmark pathways from the mouse Molecular Signatures Database were utilized to characterize the molecular function of the IM subpopulation in response to hypoxia.\nRESULTS: Our analysis revealed an early acute inflammatory phase during acute hypoxia exposure (Days 1-3), which was resolved by Day 7, followed by a pro-remodeling phase during prolonged hypoxia (Days 7-21). These phases were marked by distinct subpopulations of IMs: MHCII\nDISCUSSION: Our findings demonstrate the existence of distinct populations of pulmonary interstitial macrophages corresponding to acute and prolonged hypoxia exposure, pivotal in regulating the inflammatory and remodeling phases of PH pathogenesis. This understanding offers potential avenues for targeted interventions, tailored to specific populations and distinct phases of the disease. Moreover, further identification of triggers for pro-remodeling IMs holds promise in unveiling novel therapeutic strategies for pulmonary hypertension.", "pmid": "38690277", "score": 3, "selected": true}, {"title": "Possible Mechanisms for Adverse Cardiac Events Caused by Exercise-Induced Hypertension in Long-Distance Middle-Aged Runners: A Review.", "authors_str": "Kim YJ; Park KM", "doi": "10.3390/jcm13082184", "abstract": "Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is rare among athletes. However, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is the leading cause of SCD among those <35 years of age. Meanwhile, coronary artery disease (CAD) is the primary SCD cause among those \u226535 years of age. CAD-induced plaque ruptures are believed to be a significant cause of cardiovascular diseases in middle-aged individuals who participate in extreme long-distance running activities such as marathons. A total of 1970 articles related to EIH were identified using search terms. Out of these, 1946 studies were excluded for reasons such as arterial hypertension, exercise-induced pulmonary hypertension, the absence of exercise stress testing (EST), and a lack of relevance to EIH. The study analyzed 24 studies related to both long-distance runners with exercise-induced hypertension (EIH) and the general public. Among these, 11 studies were quasi-experimentally designed studies used in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on long-distance runners with EIH. Additionally, 12 studies utilized cohort designs, and one study with a quasi-experimental design was conducted among the general population. Recent studies suggest that an imbalance between oxygen demand and supply due to ventricular hypertrophy may be the actual cause of cardiovascular disease, regardless of CAD. Exercising excessively over an extended period can reduce endothelial function and increase arterial stiffness, which in turn increases afterload and leads to an excessive increase in blood pressure during exercise. Exercise-induced hypertension (EIH), which increases the morbidity rate of resting hypertension and is a risk factor for cardio-cerebro-vascular diseases, is more prevalent in middle-aged long-distance runners than in runners from other age groups, and it increases the prevalence of critical arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation or ventricular arrhythmias. EIH is associated with angiotensin II activity, and angiotensin II receptor blockers show promising effects in middle-aged runners. Further, guidelines for preventing excessive participation in races and restricting exercise intensity and frequency would be useful. This review identifies EIH as a potential risk factor for cardiovascular diseases and describes how EIH induces SCD.", "pmid": "38673457", "score": 2, "selected": true}, {"title": "Severe pulmonary hypertension and circulatory failure associated with Congenital syphilis.

Specifically, the increased intracardiac pressure and right ventricular hypertrophy associated with PH would seemingly increase the intrapericardial pressure threshold at which the right-sided chambers collapse. In this systematic review, we examined the impact of PH on the incidence, in-hospital and long-term mortality, and echocardiographic findings of patients with cardiac tamponade. Using the PRISMA guideline, a systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Academic Search Premier, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane Database for studies investigating PH and cardiac tamponade. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to analyze the quality of returned studies. Primary outcomes included the incidence of cardiac tamponade, as well as in-hospital and long-term mortality rates. Secondary outcomes were the presence or absence of echocardiographic findings of cardiac tamponade in patients with PH. Forty-three studies (9 cohort studies and 34 case reports) with 1054 patients were included. The incidence of cardiac tamponade was significantly higher in patients with PH compared to those without PH, 2.0% (95% CI 1.2-3.2%) vs. 0.05% (95% CI 0.05-0.05%), p\u2009<\u20090.0001, OR 40.76 (95% CI 24.8-66.9).

It is unknown if a trial of labor carries a lower risk of morbidity in these patients compared to a planned cesarean delivery. The objective of this study was to examine the association of delivery mode with severe maternal morbidity events during delivery hospitalization among patients with pulmonary hypertension.\nMETHODS: This retrospective cohort study used the Premier inpatient administrative database. Patients delivering \u226525 weeks gestation from January 1, 2016, to September 30, 2020, and with pulmonary hypertension were included. The primary analysis compared intended vaginal delivery (ie, trial of labor) to intended cesarean delivery (intention to treat analysis). A sensitivity analysis was conducted comparing vaginal delivery to cesarean delivery (as treated analysis). The primary outcome was nontransfusion severe maternal morbidity during the delivery hospitalization. Secondary outcomes included blood transfusion (4 or more units) and readmission to the delivery hospital within 90 days from discharge from delivery hospitalization.\nRESULTS: The cohort consisted of 727 deliveries. In the primary analysis, there was no difference in nontransfusion morbidity between intended vaginal delivery and intended cesarean delivery groups (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.49-1.15). In secondary analyses, intended cesarean delivery was not associated with blood transfusion (aOR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.34-1.50) or readmission within 90 days (aOR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.32-1.14). In the sensitivity analysis, cesarean delivery was associated with a 3-fold higher risk of nontransfusion morbidity compared to vaginal delivery (aOR, 2.64; 95% CI, 1.54-3.93), a 3-fold higher risk of blood transfusion (aOR, 3.06; 95% CI, 1.17-7.99), and a 2-fold higher risk of readmission within 90 days (aOR, 2.20; 95% CI, 1.09-4.46) compared to vaginal delivery.\nCONCLUSIONS: Among pregnant patients with pulmonary hypertension, a trial of labor was not associated with a higher risk of morbidity compared to an intended cesarean delivery.

Fifty seven (20%) had PAH-LHD according to the AMBITION definition. Compared with no-LHD ones, they were older, had higher BMI, more cardiovascular comorbidities, higher E/e' ratio and left atrial area, but lower BNP concentrations and better right ventricular function and pulmonary hemodynamics. Survival was comparable between PAH-LHD and no-LHD patients, although the former were less commonly treated with dual PAH therapy. Both COMPERA and COMPERA 2.0 discriminated all-cause mortality risk of PAH-LHD at follow-up, but not at baseline. Risk profile significantly improved during follow-up only when assessed by COMPERA 2.0.

The cohort had a mean age of 57.6 years, with 56.9% males, and was stratified by NYHA functional class II-IV. Outcomes assessed included mortality, complication rates, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP), with statistical analysis performed using t-tests and chi-square tests for continuous and categorical data, respectively.\nRESULTS: Postoperative outcomes varied significantly with age, NYHA class, and PASP grade. Patients aged \u226460 exhibited an average PASP reduction of 44.46% in the male group and 44.44% in the female group and an LVEF improvement of 5.28% in the male group and 5.80% in the female group. However, these patients showed a higher risk of postoperative complications, such as renal failure, arrhythmia, low cardiac output syndrome, respiratory insufficiency, (23.31%), and a higher mortality rate (13.53%)(P < .05). Higher NYHA classes correlated with increased postoperative risks of complications and mortality rates, and elevated PASP grades were associated with larger improvements in PASP and LVEF but also higher postoperative risks.\nCONCLUSION: Valve surgery in valvular heart disease with PAH is influenced by patient age, functional status, and PAH severity.

However, long-term outcomes in the current era remain largely unknown. We sought to evaluate the implications of acute vasoreactivity response for long-term response to CCBs and other outcomes.\nMETHODS: Patients diagnosed with PAH between January 1999 and December 2018 at 15 pulmonary hypertension centers were included and analyzed retrospectively. In accordance with current guidelines, acute vasoreactivity response was defined by a decrease of mean pulmonary artery pressure by \u226510 mm Hg to reach <40 mm Hg, without a decrease in cardiac output. Long-term response to CCBs was defined as alive with unchanged initial CCB therapy with or without other initial PAH therapy and World Health Organization functional classification I/II or low European Society of Cardiology/European Respiratory Society risk status at 12 months after initiation of CCBs. Patients were followed for up to 5 years; clinical measures, outcome, and subsequent treatment patterns were captured.\nRESULTS: Of 3702 patients undergoing right heart catheterization for PAH diagnosis, 2051 had idiopathic, hereditary, or drug-induced PAH, of whom 1904 (92.8%) underwent acute vasoreactivity testing. A total of 162 patients fulfilled acute vasoreactivity response criteria and received an initial CCB alone (n=123) or in combination with another PAH therapy (n=39). The median follow-up time was 60.0 months (interquartile range, 30.8-60.0), during which overall survival was 86.7%. At 12 months, 53.2% remained on CCB monotherapy, 14.7% on initial CCB plus another initial PAH therapy, and the remaining patients had the CCB withdrawn or PAH therapy added. CCB long-term response was found in 54.3% of patients. Five-year survival was 98.5% in long-term responders versus 73.0% in nonresponders. In addition to established vasodilator responder criteria, pulmonary artery compliance at acute vasoreactivity testing, low risk status and NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide) levels at early follow-up correlated with long-term response and predicted survival.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our data display heterogeneity within the group of vasoresponders, with a large subset failing to show a sustained satisfactory clinical response to CCBs.
