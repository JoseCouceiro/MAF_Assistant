Over the last decade, percutaneous closure is increasingly undertaken, with results similar to cardiac surgery. We present a case of ST-elevated anterior AMI, complicated by apical PIVSD successfully treated with transcatheter closure.\nCASE REPORT: An 83-year-old man was hospitalized for chest pain occurred 18 hours before, during the night time. He was an active smoker. Clinical examination revealed normal heart sounds and pulmonary bibasilar crackles. ST-segment elevation with deep T waves inversion in anterior leads were detected on the electrocardiogram. A mildly-reduced ejection fraction (40%) was found by transthoracic echocardiogram. The patient underwent emergency coronary angiography, which revealed a subocclusive stenosis of the mid left anterior descending artery with a TIMI 2 flow, treated by balloon angioplasty and drug-eluting stent. Four days after revascularization, the patient developed an acute deterioration with signs of decompensated heart failure and a new holosystolic murmur with large irradiation. Inotropic agents' administration was required to maintain a precarious hemodynamic condition. A bedside Echo revealed an apical VSD, measuring 15 \u00d7 10 mm, with left-to-right shunting, and pulmonary hypertension. The patient was scheduled for transcatheter PIVSD closure. The procedure was performed under fluoroscopic guide. Two vascular access sites were placed, femoral arterial and right internal jugular vein. Through the right internal jugular vein, a 24-mm Amplatzer atrial septal occluder on a 9 French Amplatzer TREVISIO\u2122 intravascular delivery system was advanced via right ventricle into the PIVSD. Contrast fluoroscopy was used to assess apposition and the degree of shunt reduction before release. Echocardiographic evaluation performed 48 hours later confirmed a correct apposition of the device with insignificant residual shunt. At 6 months follow-up, he was asymptomatic, with unchanged prosthetic findings.\nCONCLUSION: Percutaneous closure has been emerged as a valid cost-effective alternative to surgery and should be advised. However, debate remains on the optimal preprocedural optimization, timing of repair and modality of treatment.", "pmid": "38262253", "score": 2, "selected": true}, {"title": "Outcomes of atrioventricular septal defects with and without down syndrome: analysis of the national inpatient database.", "authors_str": "Aly S; Qattea I; Othman H; Nguyen HH; Aly HZ", "doi": "10.1017/S1047951123003116", "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Controversial data exist about the impact of Down syndrome on outcomes after surgical repair of atrioventricular septal defect.\nAIMS: (A) assess trends and outcomes of atrioventricular septal defect with and without Down syndrome and (B) determine risk factors associated with adverse outcomes after atrioventricular septal defect repair.\nMETHODS: We queried The National Inpatient Sample using International Classification of Disease codes for patients with atrioventricular septal defect < 1 year of age from 2000 to 2018. Patients' characteristics, co-morbidities, mortality, and healthcare utilisation were evaluated by comparing those with versus without Down syndrome.\nRESULTS: In total, 2,318,706 patients with CHD were examined; of them, 61,101 (2.6%) had atrioventricular septal defect. The incidence of hospitalisation in infants with atrioventricular septal defect ranged from 4.5 to 7.5% of all infants hospitalised with CHD per year. A total of 33,453 (54.7%) patients were associated with Down syndrome. Double outlet right ventricle, coarctation of the aorta, and tetralogy of Fallot were the most commonly associated with CHD in 6.9, 5.7, and 4.3% of patients, respectively. Overall atrioventricular septal defect mortality was 6.3%. Multivariate analysis revealed that prematurity, low birth weight, pulmonary hypertension, and heart block were associated with mortality. Down syndrome was associated with a higher incidence of pulmonary hypertension (4.3 versus 2.8%, p < 0.001), less arrhythmia (6.6 versus 11.2%, p < 0.001), shorter duration for mechanical ventilation, shorter hospital stay, and less perioperative mortality (2.4 versus 11.1%, p < 0.001).\nCONCLUSION: Trends in atrioventricular septal defect hospitalisation had been stable over time. Perioperative mortality in atrioventricular septal defect was associated with prematurity, low birth weight, pulmonary hypertension, heart block, acute kidney injury, and septicaemia.

Secondary outcomes included tolerability, efficacy, adverse events, discontinuation of therapy, and changes in echocardiography.\nMETHODS: This was a single-center, retrospective review of neonates and infants <1 year of age at initiation of tadalafil for PH secondary to BPD from January 2010 to November 2021. Data collected from the electronic medical record included patient demographics, tadalafil dosing, oxygen support, mechanical ventilation, concomitant PH medications, adverse events, and echocardiography information.\nRESULTS: Forty-two patients-4 neonates and 38 infants-met the inclusion criteria. The postnatal and post-menstrual age (median, IQR) at diagnosis were 121 (35.5-153.5) days and 42.6 (40.6-47.6) weeks, respectively. The initial and highest tadalafil doses (median, range) were 1 (0.25-2) and 1 (0.5-2) mg/kg/day. Only 1 patient experienced pulmonary overcirculation and required tadalafil to be discontinued. Over half (57.1%) of the patients in this study discontinued tadalafil therapy owing to improvements in pulmonary artery pressures.\nCONCLUSIONS: Tadalafil 1 mg/kg/day was the most commonly used dose regimen in neonates and infants. Tadalafil at this dose of 1 mg/kg/day appears well tolerated in neonates and infants with PH secondary to BPD and correlates with improvements in pulmonary artery pressures.

The posttranslational modification (eg, phosphorylation and ubiquitination) of TGF-\u03b2 family receptors, including BMPR2 (bone morphogenetic protein type 2 receptor)/ALK2 (activin receptor-like kinase-2) and TGF-\u03b2R2/R1, and receptor-regulated (R) Smads significantly affects their activity and thus regulates the target cell fate. BRCC3 modifies the activity and stability of its substrate proteins through K63-dependent deubiquitination. By modulating the posttranslational modifications of the BMP/TGF-\u03b2-PPAR\u03b3 pathway, BRCC3 may play a role in pulmonary vascular remodeling, hence the pathogenesis of PAH.\nMETHODS: Bioinformatic analyses were used to explore the mechanism of BRCC3 deubiquitinates ALK2. Cultured pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs), mouse models, and specimens from patients with idiopathic PAH were used to investigate the rebalance between BMP and TGF-\u03b2 signaling in regulating ALK2 phosphorylation and ubiquitination in the context of pulmonary hypertension.\nRESULTS: BRCC3 was significantly downregulated in PASMCs from patients with PAH and animals with experimental pulmonary hypertension. BRCC3, by de-ubiquitinating ALK2 at Lys-472 and Lys-475, activated receptor-regulated Smad1/5/9 (Smad1/5/9), which resulted in transcriptional activation of BMP-regulated PPAR\u03b3, p53, and Id1. Overexpression of BRCC3 also attenuated TGF-\u03b2 signaling by downregulating TGF-\u03b2 expression and inhibiting phosphorylation of Smad3. Experiments in vitro indicated that overexpression of BRCC3 or the de-ubiquitin-mimetic ALK2-K472/475R attenuated PASMC proliferation and migration and enhanced PASMC apoptosis. In SM22\u03b1-BRCC3-Tg mice, pulmonary hypertension was ameliorated because of activation of the ALK2-Smad1/5-PPAR\u03b3 axis in PASMCs. In contrast, \nCONCLUSIONS: These results suggest a pivotal role of BRCC3 in sustaining pulmonary vascular homeostasis by maintaining the integrity of the BMP signaling (ie, the ALK2-Smad1/5-PPAR\u03b3 axis) while suppressing TGF-\u03b2 signaling in PASMCs.

We selected reports in which pulmonary hypertension was diagnosed by echocardiography or catheterization, for any age, sex, or dosage of vitamin C. We extracted quantitative data for our analysis. We used the mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) as the outcome of primary interest.\nRESULTS: We identified 32 case reports, 21 of which were published in the last 5 years. Dyspnea was reported in 69%, edema in 53% and fatigue in 28% of the patients. Vitamin C plasma levels, measured in 27 cases, were undetectable in 24 and very low in 3 cases.

Patients with overlap syndrome have a worse prognosis compared with chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder or OSA alone. Additionally, patients with combined chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder and OSA are more likely to develop pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure much earlier than those without overlap.\nAIM: To assess the occurrence of pulmonary hypertension (PH) in newly diagnosed OSA-chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder overlap syndrome patients attending a tertiary care centre.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted at Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Government Medical College, Kozhikode, Kerala, South India, among patients with OSA above 40\u00a0years of age who were proactively evaluated to pick out those with undiagnosed overlap. A period of 6\u00a0months after getting ethical clearance from June 2018 was selected as the study period. Among patients with symptoms suggestive of OSA above 40\u00a0years of age who gave the informed consent were enrolled after screening with Standard Sleep questionnaires (Berlin questionnaire, STOP BANG and Epworth Sleepiness Scale).

Mutations in the paired-like homeobox 2B (PHOX2B) gene impair respiratory drive, causing hypercarbia and hypoxaemia. Most patients with CCHS are diagnosed in the neonatal period; however, a few are diagnosed in adulthood.\nCASE SUMMARY: We report a 32-year-old man with a history of unexplained cyanosis 14 days after birth. He presented to our hospital with breathlessness and abnormal electrocardiogram findings discovered in a health check-up. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) was suspected based on electrocardiographic and echocardiographic evidence of right ventricular (RV) overload. Results of pulmonary function tests and chest computed tomography were normal. Arterial blood gas analysis revealed type 2 respiratory failure without a significant alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient, indicating alveolar hypoventilation. Right heart catheterization (RHC) showed pre-capillary PH [pulmonary artery pressure 47/24 (35) mmHg], and a hyperventilation challenge test and a non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) treatment during RHC provided drastic improvement in PH [pulmonary artery pressure 28/12 (18) mmHg]. Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome was diagnosed based on genetic testing (20/25 polyalanine repeat expansion mutations in PHOX2B). After NPPV therapy initiation, the RV overload was slightly improved.\nDISCUSSION: Some patients with CCHS develop mild hypoventilation without overt clinical signs, and PH can be the first clinical manifestation. In our case, the hyperventilation challenge test improved PH.

AA can subsequently worsen RV function. Current guidelines do not provide comprehensive recommendations for the management of AA in PH.

Handgrip strength was shown to be negatively connected with pro-brain natriuretic peptide (r = -0.565, p = 0.023) and positively correlated with 6-minute walk test (r = 0.586, p = 0.022) during the patient group evaluation.\nCONCLUSION: Six-minute walk test needs a customised physical area (30 m of a straight hallway) and trained personnel for applying the test. The handgrip strength test, a different muscle strength indicator, can be used to more clearly and simply indicate the decline in patients' ability for effort. Additionally, it was found in our study that handgrip strength decreased as pro-brain natriuretic peptide levels rose, a crucial measure in the monitoring of pulmonary hypertension.", "pmid": "38450520", "score": 2, "selected": true}, {"title": "Status and Future Directions for Balloon Pulmonary Angioplasty in Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Disease With and Without Pulmonary Hypertension: A Scientific Statement From the American Heart Association.", "authors_str": "Aggarwal V; Giri J; Visovatti SH; Mahmud E; Matsubara H; Madani M; Rogers F; Gopalan D; Rosenfield K; McLaughlin VV; American Heart Association Council on Clinical Cardiology; Council on Peripheral Vascular Disease; Council on Cardiopulmonary, Critical Care, Perioperative and Resuscitation; and Council on Cardiovascular and Stroke Nursing", "doi": "10.1161/CIR.0000000000001197", "abstract": "Balloon pulmonary angioplasty continues to gain traction as a treatment option for patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary disease with and without pulmonary hypertension.

In recent years, balloon pulmonary angioplasty (BPA) has emerged as an effective treatment option for patients ineligible for pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA).

Here, we compared post-BPA outcomes between CTEPH patients with and without chronic pulmonary disease at baseline and analyzed predictors of BPA success.\nMETHODS: From August 2017 to October 2022, 62 patients with inoperable CTEPH who underwent BPA were consecutively enrolled and grouped based on the presence of a pulmonary comorbidity at baseline. All patients underwent transthoracic echocardiography, pulmonary function tests, and right heart catheterization. Pre- and post-BPA data were evaluated to identify factors that influence the success of BPA.\nRESULTS: Among the 62 CTEPH patients, BPA was considered successful in 50 patients and unsuccessful in 12 patients. Responders to BPA had better exercise capacity and right heart function at baseline, but no differences in hemodynamic or respiratory function were detected between the groups. In CTEPH patients with chronic pulmonary disease (n\u00a0=\u00a014), BPA significantly improved mean pulmonary arterial pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance and right heart function parameters. Only CTEPH patients without chronic pulmonary disease (n\u00a0=\u00a048) exhibited significant improvement in 6-minute walk distance and respiratory function.

Clinical, hemodynamic, and functional parameters were obtained at an initial visit, follow-up visits, and a final visit at the end of 3\u00a0years' observation or end of follow-up. Data were recorded on electronic case report forms. Parameters evaluated included 6-minute walking distance (6MWD), use of pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA), balloon pulmonary angioplasty (BPA), pulmonary hypertension (PH)-targeted therapy, and survival. All statistical analyses were exploratory and descriptive, and were performed in the overall population.\nRESULTS: The most common symptoms were typical of those expected for CTEPH.

The pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), a secretory protein widely distributed in multiple organs, has been shown to demonstrate anti-EndoMT activity in cardiovascular diseases. In the present study, the role of PEDF in PH was investigated.\nMETHODS: For PEDF overexpression, Sprague Dawley rats were infected with an adeno-associated virus through injection via the internal jugular vein. To establish PH models, the animals were subjected to monocrotaline or Sugen/hypoxia. Four weeks later, pulmonary artery angiography was performed, and hemodynamic parameters, right ventricular function, and vascular remodeling were evaluated. EndoMT and cell proliferation in the pulmonary arteries were assessed via immunofluorescence staining. Moreover, pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAECs) isolated from experimental PH rats were cultured to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms involved.\nRESULTS: PEDF expression was significantly downregulated in PAECs from PH patients and PH model rats. Overexpressed PEDF alleviated the development of PH by improving pulmonary artery morphology and perfusion, reducing pulmonary artery pressure, improving right ventricular function, and alleviating vascular remodeling. PEDF inhibits EndoMT and reduces excessive PAEC proliferation. Moreover, PEDF overexpression reduced EndoMT in cultured PAECs by competitively inhibiting the binding of wnt to LRP6 and downregulating phosphorylation at the 1490 site of LRP6.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that PEDF may be a potential therapeutic target for PH.

Furthermore, we discuss relevant in vitro and in vivo models that support the benefits or drawbacks of angiogenesis in CTEPH progression.

Patients were classified into three groups: non-PH, precapillary PH and postcapillary PH, based on values obtained from RHC. Using 24 parameters, we created predictive models employing four different classifiers and selected the one with the highest area under the curve. We then calculated the macro-average classification accuracy for PH on the derivation cohort (n=720) and prospective validation data set (n=165), comparing the results with guideline-based echocardiographic assessment obtained from each cohort.\nRESULTS: Logistic regression with elastic net regularisation had the highest classification accuracy, with areas under the curves of 0.789, 0.766 and 0.742 for normal, precapillary PH and postcapillary PH, respectively.

Microtubule, a cytoskeletal protein, has been shown to regulate cardiomyocyte viscoelasticity. Additionally, hypertrophied cardiomyocytes from failing myocardium have increased microtubules and cell stiffness. How the microtubules contribute to the tissue-level viscoelastic behavior in RV failure remains unknown. Our aim was to investigate the role of the microtubules in the passive anisotropic viscoelasticity of the RV free wall (RVFW) during pulmonary hypertension (PH) progression. Equibiaxial stress relaxation tests were conducted in the RVFW from healthy and PH rats under early (6%) and end (15%) diastolic strains, and at sub- (1Hz) and physiological (5Hz) stretch-rates. The RVFW viscoelasticity was also measured before and after the depolymerization of microtubules at 5Hz. In intact tissues, PH increased RV viscosity and elasticity at both stretch rates and strain levels, and the increase was stronger in the circumferential than longitudinal direction. At 6% of strain, the removal of microtubules reduced elasticity, viscosity, and the ratio of viscosity to elasticity in both directions and for both healthy and diseased RVs. However, at 15% of strain, the effect of microtubules was different between groups - both viscosity and elasticity were reduced in healthy RVs, but in the diseased RVs only the circumferential viscosity and the ratio of viscosity to elasticity were reduced. These data suggest that, at a large strain with collagen recruitment, microtubules play more significant roles in healthy RV tissue elasticity and diseased RV tissue viscosity. Our findings suggest cardiomyocyte cytoskeletons are critical to RV passive viscoelasticity under pressure overload. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: This study investigated the impact of microtubules on the passive anisotropic viscoelasticity of the right ventricular (RV) free wall at healthy and pressure-overloaded states. We originally found that the microtubules contribute significantly to healthy and diseased RV viscoelasticity in both (longitudinal and circumferential) directions at early diastolic strains. At end diastolic strains (with the engagement of collagen fibers), microtubules contribute more to the tissue elasticity of healthy RVs and tissue viscosity of diseased RVs. Our findings reveal the critical role of microtubules in the anisotropic viscoelasticity of the RV tissue, and the altered contribution from healthy to diseased state suggests that therapies targeting microtubules may have potentials for RV failure patients.", "pmid": "38272197", "score": 3, "selected": true}, {"title": "Impact of tricuspid regurgitation severity on mortality in pulmonary hypertension patients: A comprehensive analysis.", "authors_str": "Albulushi A; Al-Saidi K; Al-Farhan H", "doi": "10.1016/j.cpcardiol.2024.102405", "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pulmonary hypertension (PH) presents as a complex cardiovascular condition with a highly variable prognosis.

Our scRNA-seq results revealed significant alterations in three crucial signaling pathways in IPAH: the hypoxia pathway, TGF \u03b2 pathway, and ROS pathway, primarily attributed to changes in gene expression within arterial endothelial cells. Moreover, through bulk RNA sequencing analysis, we identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) enriched in GO and KEGG pathways, implicated in regulating cell adhesion and oxidative phosphorylation in IPAH lungs. Similarly, DEGs-enriched pathways in IPAH arterial endothelial cells were also identified.

Spermidine (SPD), a potent facilitator of autophagy, has been identified as a significant contributor to PAECs function and survival. Despite SPD's observed benefits, a comprehensive understanding of its protective mechanisms has remained elusive. Through an integrated approach combining metabolomics and molecular biology, this study uncovers the molecular pathways employed by SPD in mitigating PAH induced by monocrotaline (MCT) in a Sprague-Dawley rat model. The study demonstrates that SPD administration (5\u00a0mg/kg/day) significantly corrects right ventricular impairment and pathological changes in pulmonary tissues following MCT exposure (60\u00a0mg/kg). Metabolomic profiling identified a purine metabolism disorder in MCT-treated rats, which SPD effectively normalized, conferring a protective effect against PAH progression. Subsequent in vitro analysis showed that SPD (0.8\u00a0mM) reduces oxidative stress and apoptosis in PAECs challenged with Dehydromonocrotaline (MCTP, 50\u00a0\u03bcM), likely by downregulating purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) and modulating polyamine biosynthesis through alterations in S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AMD1) expression and the subsequent production of decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine (dcSAM).

However, due to progressive heart failure, prognoses and survival rates are much worse in PAH. Patients with PAH are at a higher risk of developing supraventricular arrhythmias and malignant ventricular arrhythmias. The latter underlie sudden cardiac death regardless of the mechanical cardiac dysfunction. Systemic chronic inflammation and oxidative stress are causal factors that increase the risk of the occurrence of cardiac arrhythmias in hypertension. These stressful factors contribute to endothelial dysfunction and arterial pressure overload, resulting in the development of cardiac pro-arrhythmic conditions, including myocardial structural, ion channel and connexin43 (Cx43) channel remodeling and their dysfunction. Myocardial fibrosis appears to be a crucial proarrhythmic substrate linked with myocardial electrical instability due to the downregulation and abnormal topology of electrical coupling protein Cx43. Furthermore, these conditions promote ventricular mechanical dysfunction and heart failure. The treatment algorithm in HTN is superior to PAH, likely due to the paucity of comprehensive pathomechanisms and causal factors for a multitargeted approach in PAH. The intention of this review is to provide information regarding the role of Cx43 in the development of cardiac arrhythmias in hypertensive heart disease.

This review suggests that the potential of natural flavonoids as alternative therapeutic agents in the prevention and treatment of PAH holds promise for future research and clinical applications.\nCONCLUSION: Despite displaying the enormous potential of flavonoids in PAH, some limitations need to be further explored. Firstly, using advanced drug discovery tools, including computer-aided design and high-throughput screening, to further investigate the safety, biological activity, and precise mechanism of action of flavonoids.

However, the impact of these remodeling mechanisms on RV mechanics in not clearly understood. In addition, there is a lack of quantitative understanding of how each mechanism individually influences RV mechanics. Utilizing experimental data from a rat model of PAH at three distinct time points, we developed biventricular finite element models to investigate how RV stress and strain evolved with PAH progression. The finite element models were fitted to hemodynamic and morphological data to represent different disease stages and used to analyze the impact of RV remodeling as well as the altered RV pressure. Furthermore, we performed a number of theoretical simulation studies with different combinations of morphological and physiological remodeling, to assess and quantify their individual impact on overall RV load and function. Our findings revealed a substantial 4-fold increase in RV stiffness and a transient 2-fold rise in contractility, which returned to baseline by week 12. These changes in RV material properties in addition to the 2-fold increase in wall thickness significantly mitigated the increase in wall stress and strain caused by the progressive increase in RV afterload. Despite the PAH-induced cases showing increased wall stress and strain at end-diastole and end-systole compared to the control, our simulations suggest that without the observed remodeling mechanisms, the increase in stress and strain would have been much more pronounced. Our model analysis also indicated that while changes in the RV's material properties-particularly increased RV stiffness - have a notable effect on its mechanics, the primary compensatory factor limiting the stress and strain increase in the early stages of PAH was the significant increase in wall thickness.

The proliferation of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) induced by the nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) signaling activation plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of PAH. Forsythoside B (FTS\u2022B) possesses inhibitory effect on NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. The present study aims to explore the effects and mechanisms of FTS\u2022B in PAH.\nMETHODS: Sprague-Dawley rats received monocrotaline (MCT) intraperitoneal injection to establish PAH model, and FTS\u2022B was co-treated after MCT injection. Right ventricular hypertrophy and pulmonary artery pressure were measured by echocardiography and right heart catheterization, respectively. Histological alterations were detected by H&E staining and immunohistochemistry. FTS\u2022B's role in PASMC proliferation and migration were evaluated by CCK-8 and wound healing assay. To investigate the underlying mechanisms, Western blotting, immunofluorescence staining and ELISA were conducted. The NF-\u03baB activator PMA was used to investigate the role of NF-\u03baB in FTS\u2022B's protective effects against PAH.\nRESULTS: FTS\u2022B markedly alleviated MCT-induced vascular remodeling and pulmonary artery pressure, and improved right ventricular hypertrophy and survival. FTS\u2022B also reversed PDGF-BB-induced PASMC proliferation and migration, decreased PCNA and CyclinD1 expression in vitro. The elevated levels of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 caused by MCT were decreased by FTS\u2022B. Mechanistically, MCT-triggered phosphorylation of p65, I\u03baB\u03b1, IKK\u03b1 and IKK\u03b2 was blunted by FTS\u2022B. FTS\u2022B also reversed MCT-induced nuclear translocation of p65. However, all these protective effects were blocked by PMA-mediated NF-\u03baB activation.\nCONCLUSION: FTS\u2022B effectively attenuates PAH by suppressing the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway to attenuate vascular remodeling.

Right heart catheterisation (RHC) referral performances for PAH were compared according to the 2022 ESC/ERS PAH criteria.\nRESULTS: Thirty-five of the 81 patients required RHC; 15 (18.5%) according to ESC/ERS, 27 (33.3%) according to DETECT, and 25 (31%) according to ASIG. The final diagnoses were no-PH in 17 patients, WHO group 1 PH (PAH) in 8 patients, WHO group 2 PH in 8 patients, and WHO group 3 PH in 2 patients.

The relative role of these parameters in the risk stratification of PAH patients is unclear. We compared the performance of multiple RV parameters and sought to establish an optimal model for identifying the risk profile of patients with PAH.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Comprehensive risk assessments were performed for 70 patients with PAH. The risk profile of every patient was determined based on the guideline recommendations. Conventional parameters, including fractional area change (FAC) and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), novel speckle-tracking-derived RV longitudinal strain (RVLS), and three-dimensional RV ejection fraction (3D-RVEF), were used to evaluate RV function. Pressure-strain loops were measured for the assessment of RV myocardial work, including RV global wasted work (RVGWW). RV-pulmonary artery coupling was assessed by indexing RV parameters to the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP). The median age was 34 (30-43) years, and 62 (88.6%) patients were female. Forty-five patients were classified into the low-risk group, while 25 patients were classified into the intermediate-high-risk group. Most RV parameters could be used to determine the risk profile and exhibited significantly improved diagnostic performance after indexing to PASP (including FAC/PASP, TAPSE/PASP, and 3D-RVEF/PASP). RVLS/PASP showed the best performance, with an area under the curve of 0.895. In multivariate analysis (Model 1), only RVGWW (>90.5\u00a0mmHg%), RVLS (>\u00a0-16.7%), and TAPSE (<17.5\u00a0mm) remained significant (all P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Model 1 outperformed every single RV parameter, with a significantly larger area under the curve (all P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). With PASP indexing in Model 2, RVLS/PASP\u00a0>\u00a0-0.275 [odds ratio (OR) 20.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.62-92.11, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001] and RVGWW\u00a0>\u00a090.5\u00a0mmHg% (OR 6.17, 95% CI 1.37-27.76, P\u00a0=\u00a00.018) independently identified a higher risk profile.

As immunity has been involved in the development and progression of vascular lesions in PAH, we review the potential contribution of B cells in its pathogenesis and evaluate the relevance of B cell-targeted therapies. Circulating B cell homeostasis is altered in PAH patients, with total B-cell lymphopenia, abnormal subset distribution (expansion of na\u00efve and antibody-secreting cells, reduction of memory B cells) and chronic activation. B cells are recruited to the lungs through local chemokine secretion, and activated by several mechanisms: 1) interaction with lung vascular auto-antigens through cognate B cell receptors; 2) co-stimulatory signals provided by T follicular helper (Tfh) cells (IL-21), T helper 2 (Th2) cells and mast cells (IL-4, IL-6 and IL-13); and 3) increased survival signals provided by B cell activating factor (BAFF) pathways. This activity results in the formation of germinal centres within perivascular tertiary lymphoid organs and in the local production of pathogenic autoantibodies that target the pulmonary vasculature and vascular stabilization factors (including angiotensin-II/endothelin-1 receptors and bone morphogenetic protein receptors). B cells also mediate their effects through enhanced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, reduced anti-inflammatory properties by regulatory B cells, IgG-induced complement activation, and IgE-induced mast cell activation.

Supporting a genetic predisposition to NCOA7 deficiency, in genome-edited, stem cell-derived ECs, the common variant intronic SNP rs11154337 in NCOA7 regulated NCOA7 expression, lysosomal activity, oxysterol/bile acid production, and EC immunoactivation. Correspondingly, SNP rs11154337 was associated with PAH severity via six-minute walk distance and mortality in discovery (N=93, P=0.0250; HR=0.44, 95% CI [0.21-0.90]) and validation (N=630, P=2x10-4; HR=0.49, 95% CI [0.34-0.71]) cohorts. Finally, utilizing computational modeling of small molecule binding to NCOA7, we predicted and synthesized a novel activator of NCOA7 that prevented EC immunoactivation and reversed indices of rodent PAH. In summary, we have established a genetic and metabolic paradigm and a novel therapeutic agent that links lysosomal biology as well as oxysterol and bile acid processes to EC inflammation and PAH pathobiology. This paradigm carries broad implications for diagnostic and therapeutic development in PAH and in other conditions dependent upon acquired and innate immune regulation of vascular disease.", "pmid": "38464060", "score": 2, "selected": true}, {"title": "Effect of free and nanoemulsified \u03b2-caryophyllene on monocrotaline-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension.", "authors_str": "Carraro CC; Turck P; Bahr A; Donatti L; Corssac G; Lacerda D; da Rosa Araujo AS; de Castro AL; Koester L; Bell\u00f3-Klein A", "doi": "10.1016/j.bbamcr.2024.119704", "abstract": "Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is characterized by increased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), right ventricular (RV) failure and premature death.

Clinical trial data from serum of 18 healthy individuals and 18 patients with PAH were retrospectively analyzed. Concentrations of calcium and potassium ions were determined and compared. Datasets were retrieved, selecting genes associated with calcium ion release. R packages processed the datasets, filtering 174 common genes, and conducting Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analyses. Six hub genes were identified, and nomogram and logistic regression prediction models were constructed. Random forest filtered cross genes, and a diagnostic model was developed and validated using an artificial neural network.

The metabolome has been implicated in the pathogenesis of PAH, but previous works have lacked power to implicate specific metabolites. Mendelian randomization (MR) is a method for causal inference between exposures and outcomes.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Using genome-wide association study summary statistics, we implemented MR analysis to test for potential causal relationships between serum concentration of 575 metabolites and PAH. Five metabolites were causally associated with the risk of PAH after multiple testing correction. Next, we measured serum concentration of candidate metabolites in an independent clinical cohort of 449 patients with PAH to check whether metabolite concentrations are correlated with markers of disease severity. Of the 5 candidates nominated by our MR work, serine was negatively associated and homostachydrine was positively associated with clinical severity of PAH via direct measurement in this independent clinical cohort. Finally we used conditional and orthogonal approaches to explore the biology underlying our lead metabolites. Rare variant burden testing was carried out using whole exome sequencing data from 578 PAH cases and 361\u2009675 controls. Multivariable MR is an extension of MR that uses a single set of instrumental single-nucleotide polymorphisms to measure multiple exposures; multivariable MR is used to determine interdependence between the effects of different exposures on a single outcome. Rare variant analysis demonstrated that loss-of-function mutations within activating transcription factor 4, a transcription factor responsible for upregulation of serine synthesis under conditions of serine starvation, are associated with higher risk for PAH. Homostachydrine is a xenobiotic metabolite that is structurally related to l-proline betaine, which has previously been linked to modulation of inflammation and tissue remodeling in PAH. Our multivariable MR analysis suggests that the effect of l-proline betaine is actually mediated indirectly via homostachydrine.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our data present a method for study of the metabolome in the context of PAH, and suggests several candidates for further evaluation and translational research.", "pmid": "38456412", "score": 3, "selected": true}, {"title": "Multi-biobank summary data Mendelian randomisation does not support a causal effect of IL-6 signalling on risk of pulmonary arterial hypertension.", "authors_str": "Woolf B; Perry JA; Hong CC; Wilkins MR; Toshner M; Gill D; Burgess S; Rhodes CJ", "doi": "10.1183/13993003.02031-2023", "abstract": null, "pmid": "38453257", "score": 3, "selected": true}, {"title": "High altitude travelling with pulmonary arterial hypertension.", "authors_str": "Naeije R", "doi": "10.1183/13993003.00111-2024", "abstract": null, "pmid": "38453244", "score": 2, "selected": true}, {"title": "Macitentan in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Associated with Connective Tissue Disease (CTD-PAH): Real-World Evidence from the Combined OPUS/OrPHeUS Dataset.", "authors_str": "Channick R; Chin KM; McLaughlin VV; Lammi MR; Zamanian RT; Turricchia S; Ong R; Mitchell L; Kim NH", "doi": "10.1007/s40119-024-00361-w", "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Data on real-world clinical practice and outcomes of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with connective tissue disease (CTD-PAH) are scarce.

In vivo and in vitro experiments confirm that the mitochondria of PASMCs were damaged during PAH, and the superoxide and mtDNA produced by injured mitochondria activate the cGAS-STING-NF\u03baB pathway to promote PAH process, while CGRP could play an anti-PAH role by protecting the mitochondria and inhibiting the cGAS-STING-NF\u03baB pathway through PKA.\nCONCLUSION: This study identifies that CGRP attenuates cGAS-STING-NF\u03baB axis-mediated vascular remodeling in PAH through PKA.", "pmid": "38408681", "score": 2, "selected": true}, {"title": "Quality of Life and the Cardiopulmonary Exercise Test in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Patients.", "authors_str": "Mart\u00ednez-Me\u00f1aca A; Mora-Cuesta VM; Iturbe-Fern\u00e1ndez D; S\u00e1inz-Ezquerra Belmonte B; Fern\u00e1ndez-Cavia G; Gallardo-Ruiz MJ", "doi": "10.1016/j.arbres.2024.01.016", "abstract": null, "pmid": "38402048", "score": 4, "selected": true}, {"title": "Corrigendum to Macrophage-derived inflammation promotes pulmonary vascular remodeling in hypoxia-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension mice [Immunology Letters 263 (2023) 113-122 /IMLET_6819].", "authors_str": "Liu H", "doi": "10.1016/j.imlet.2024.106843", "abstract": null, "pmid": "38401398", "score": 2, "selected": true}, {"title": "Prognostic value of tricuspid valve regurgitation in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension and CTEPH: A longitudinal study.", "authors_str": "Veen KM; Koudstaal T; Hendriks PM; Takkenberg JJ; Boomars KA; van den Bosch AE", "doi": "10.1016/j.ijcha.2024.101342", "abstract": "AIMS: The prognostic value of functional tricuspid valve regurgitation (TR) in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) remains undetermined.

Prior work has shown that microvascular endothelial cells (MVECs) isolated from animals with experimental PAH and patients with PAH exhibit significant abnormalities in metabolism and calcium signaling. With regards to metabolism, we and others have shown evidence of increased aerobic glycolysis and evidence of increased utilization of alternate fuel sources (such as fatty acids) in PAH EC. In the realm of calcium signaling, our prior work linked increased activity of the transient receptor potential vanilloid-4 (TRPV4) channel to increased proliferation of MVECs isolated from the Sugen/Hypoxia rat model of PAH (SuHx-MVECs). However, the relationship between metabolic shifts and calcium abnormalities was not clear. Specifically, whether shifts in metabolism were responsible for increasing TRPV4 channel activity in SuHx-MVECs was not known. In this study, using human data, serum samples from SuHx rats, and SuHx-MVECs, we describe the consequences of increased MVEC fatty acid oxidation in PAH. In human samples, we observed an increase in long-chain fatty acid levels that was associated with PAH severity. Next, using SuHx rats and SuHx-MVECs, we observed increased intracellular levels of lipids. We also show that increasing intracellular lipid content increases TRPV4 activity, whereas inhibiting fatty acid oxidation normalizes basal calcium levels in SuHx-MVECs. By exploring the fate of fatty acid-derived carbons, we observed that the metabolite linking increased intracellular lipids to TRPV4 activity was \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate (BOHB), a product of fatty acid oxidation. Finally, we show that BOHB supplementation alone is sufficient to sensitize the TRPV4 channel in rat and mouse MVECs. Returning to humans, we observe a transpulmonary BOHB gradient in human patients with PAH. Thus, we establish a link between fatty acid oxidation, BOHB production, and TRPV4 activity in MVECs in PAH.

In total, 1944 patients with follow-up information were included; the majority were female, with World Health Organization functional class II/III symptoms and with idiopathic PAH or connective tissue disease-associated PAH. Most incident patients (N\u2009=\u20091100; diagnosed for\u2009\u2264\u20096 months) initiated treatment as monotherapy (48%) or double therapy (43%).

This phase\u00a0II open-label extension (OLE) study assessed long-term safety and tolerability of ralinepag.\nMETHODS: Participants were eligible for the OLE if they completed the parent study or experienced a clinical worsening event while receiving placebo. Those previously receiving IR ralinepag remained on their current dose, and participants formerly administered placebo were titrated to the highest tolerated dose. Participants were transitioned to an extended-release ralinepag formulation toward the end of the OLE.

The aim of this study was to investigate and compare serum levels of IL-6 in children with PAH and healthy matched controls, and correlate between IL-6 and degree of PAH, as well as mortality. IL-6 was measured by ELISA in serum samples in 40 children with PAH (age 1-12\u00a0years) and 40 age and sex-matched healthy controls.

Its use pattern with real-world evidence in Colombia is unknown.\nOBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to determine the prescription patterns of ambrisentan in some cities of Colombia.\nMETHODS: A longitudinal descriptive study on the prescription patterns of ambrisentan in patients with pulmonary hypertension (all the groups) was conducted between January 2021 and December 2022 based on a population database of members of the Colombian Health System. Adherence at 1\u2009year was determined using the Medication Possession Ratio (days the drug was dispensed/days from first dispensing to the end of the follow-up period \u00d7 100). Descriptive analysis was carried out.\nRESULTS: Sixty-seven patients taking ambrisentan were identified in 10 cities of the country. The individuals had a median age of 51.5\u00a0years (interquartile range-IQR: 39.8-64.0\u00a0years), and 82.1% were women. The drug possession rate was 82.2% (IQR: 65.0-96.8%), and persistence at 1\u00a0year was present in 49.3% (n\u2009=\u200933) of the cases.

We aimed to examine if riociguat, a direct stimulator of the nitric oxide receptor soluble guanylate cyclase, causes similar increases in vaso-occlusive events.\nMETHODS: This was a phase 1-2, randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled trial. Eligible patients were 18 years or older, had confirmed sickle cell disease documented by haemoglobin electrophoresis or HPLC fractionation (haemoglobin SS, SC, S\u03b2-thalassemia, SD, or SO-Arab), and stage 1 hypertension or proteinuria. Participants were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive either riociguat or matching placebo via a web-based system to maintain allocation concealment. Both treatments were administered orally starting at 1\u00b70 mg three times a day up to 2\u00b75 mg three times a day (highest tolerated dose) for 12 weeks. Dose escalation by 0\u00b75 mg was considered every 2 weeks if systolic blood pressure was greater than 95 mm Hg and the participant had no signs of hypotension; otherwise, the last dose was maintained. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants who had at least one adjudicated treatment-emergent serious adverse event. The analysis was performed by the intention-to-treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02633397) and was completed.\nFINDINGS: Between April 11, 2017, and Dec 31, 2021, 165 participants were screened and consented to be enrolled into the study. Of these, 130 participants were randomly assigned to either riociguat (n=66) or placebo (n=64). The proportion of participants with at least one treatment-emergent serious adverse event was 22\u00b77% (n=15) in the riociguat group and 31\u00b73% (n=20) in the placebo group (difference -8\u00b75% [90% CI -21\u00b74 to 4\u00b75]; p=0\u00b719). A similar pattern emerged in other key safety outcomes, sickle cell related vaso-occlusive events (16\u00b77 [n=11] vs 21\u00b79% [n=14]; difference -5\u00b72% [-17\u00b72 to 6\u00b75]; p=0\u00b742), mean pain severity (3\u00b718 vs 3\u00b732; adjusted mean difference -0\u00b714 [-0\u00b770 to 0\u00b742]; p=0\u00b769), and pain interference (3\u00b715 vs 3\u00b712; 0\u00b704 [-0\u00b762 to 0\u00b769]; p=0\u00b793) at 12 weeks were similar between groups. Regarding the key clinical efficacy endpoints, participants taking riociguat had a blood pressure of -8\u00b720 mm Hg (-10\u00b748 to -5\u00b791) compared with -1\u00b724 (-3\u00b758 to 1\u00b710) in those taking placebo (-6\u00b796 mm Hg (90% CI -10\u00b722 to -3\u00b769; p<0\u00b7001).\nINTERPRETATION: Riociguat was safe and had a significant haemodynamic effect on systemic blood pressure.

Skin biopsies and plasma/serum samples were obtained at baseline and week 14. Plasma cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) was assessed using radio-immunoassay. Alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1SMA) and skin thickness were determined by immunohistochemistry, mRNA markers of fibrosis by qRT-PCR in skin biopsies, and serum CXC motif chemokine ligand 4 (CXCL-4) and soluble platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (sPECAM-1) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.\nRESULTS: By week 14, cGMP increased by 94\u2009\u00b1\u200978% with riociguat and 10\u2009\u00b1\u200939% with placebo (p\u2009<\u20090.001, riociguat vs placebo). Serum sPECAM-1 and CXCL-4 decreased with riociguat vs placebo (p\u2009=\u20090.004 and p\u2009=\u20090.008, respectively). There were no differences in skin collagen markers between the 2 groups. Higher baseline serum sPECAM-1 or the detection of \u03b1SMA-positive cells in baseline skin biopsies were associated with a larger reduction of modified Rodnan skin score from baseline at week 52 with riociguat vs placebo (interaction P-values 0.004 and 0.02, respectively).\nCONCLUSION: Plasma cGMP increased with riociguat, suggesting engagement with the nitric oxide-soluble guanylate cyclase-cGMP pathway. Riociguat was associated with a significant reduction in sPECAM-1 (an angiogenic biomarker) vs placebo. Elevated sPECAM-1 and the presence of \u03b1SMA-positive skin cells may help to identify patients who could benefit from riociguat in terms of skin fibrosis.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT02283762.", "pmid": "38460548", "score": 3, "selected": true}], "portopulmonary hypertension AND pulmonary hypertension": [], "echocardiography AND pulmonary hypertension": [], "CPET AND pulmonary hypertension": []}
