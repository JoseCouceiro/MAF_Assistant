Saxagliptin for the treatment of DM, sildenafil for the treatment of ED and PAH, and macitentan for the treatment of PAH are all substrates of CYP3A4, which indicates their potential involvement in drug-drug interactions. Therefore, we investigated potential pharmacokinetic interactions between saxagliptin and sildenafil/macitentan. We investigated this speculation both in vitro and in vivo, and explored the underlying mechanism using in vitro hepatic metabolic models and molecular docking assays. The results showed that sildenafil substantially inhibited the metabolism of saxagliptin by occupying the catalytic site of CYP3A4 in a competitive manner, leading to the alterations in the pharmacokinetic properties of saxagliptin in terms of increased maximum plasma concentration (C", "pmid": "38663673", "score": 2, "selected": true}], 1], "selexipag": [[], 0], "ambrisentan": [[], 0]}
