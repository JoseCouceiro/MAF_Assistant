After a history, physical exam, and investigations, cases of suspected PH typically undergo imaging via a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). This is a resource-intensive procedure that is less accessible in remote communities. However, point of care ultrasound (POCUS), a portable ultrasound administered at the bedside, has potential to aid in the diagnostic process of PH.\nMETHODS: The MEDLINE, Embase, and CENTRAL databases were searched to screen the intersection of POCUS and PH. Studies involved adult patients, and only English articles were accepted. Reviews, case reports, unfinished research, and conference abstracts were excluded. Our aim was to identify primary studies that correlated POCUS scan results and additional clinical findings related to PH.\nRESULTS: Nine studies were included after our search. In these studies, POCUS was effective in identifying dilatation of inferior vena cava (IVC); internal jugular vein (IJV); and hepatic, portal, and intrarenal veins in patients with PH. The presence of pericardial effusion, pleural effusion, or b-lines on POCUS are also associated with PH.\nCONCLUSIONS: This review suggests important potential for the use of POCUS in the initial screening of PH. IVC and basic cardiopulmonary POCUS exams are key for PH screening in patients with dyspnea. Right-heart dilatation can be visualized, and peripheral veins may be scanned based on clinical suspicion. POCUS offers screening as an extension of a physical exam, with direct visualization of cardiac morphology. However, more studies are required to develop a statistically validated POCUS exam for PH diagnosis. More studies should also be conducted at the primary-care level to evaluate the value of screening using POCUS for PH in less-differentiated patients.", "pmid": "38681162", "score": 3, "selected": true}, {"title": "Targeting IL-11 to reduce fibrocyte circulation and lung accumulation in animal models of pulmonary hypertension-associated lung fibrosis.", "authors_str": "Milara J; Roger I; Montero P; Artigues E; Escriv\u00e1 J; Del R\u00edo R; Cortijo J", "doi": "10.1111/bph.16393", "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: IL-11 is a member of the IL-6 family of cytokine initially considered as haematopoietic and cytoprotective factor. Recent evidence indicates that IL-11 promotes lung fibrosis and pulmonary hypertension in animal models and is elevated in lung tissue of patients with pulmonary fibrosis and pulmonary hypertension. Fibrocytes are bone marrow-derived circulating cells that participate in lung fibrosis and pulmonary hypertension, but the role of IL-11 on fibrocytes is unknown. We investigated the role of IL-11 system on fibrocyte activation in different in vitro and in vivo models of lung fibrosis associated with pulmonary hypertension.\nEXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Human fibrocytes were isolated from peripheral blood of six healthy donors. Recombinant human (rh)-IL-11 and soluble rh-IL-11 receptor, \u03b1 subunit (IL-11R\u03b1) were used to stimulated fibrocytes in vitro to measure:- cell migration in a chemotactic migration chamber, fibrocyte to endothelial cell adhesion in a microscope-flow chamber and fibrocyte to myofibroblast transition. Mouse lung fibrosis and pulmonary hypertension was induced using either IL-11 (s.c.) or bleomycin (intra-tracheal), while in the rat monocrotaline (intra-tracheal) was used. In vivo siRNA-IL-11 was administered to suppress IL-11 in vivo.\nKEY RESULTS: RhIL-11 and soluble rhIL-11R\u03b1 promote fibrocyte migration, endothelial cell adhesion and myofibroblast transition. Subcutaneous (s.c.) IL-11 infusion elevates blood, bronchoalveolar and lung tissue fibrocytes. SiRNA-IL-11 transfection in bleomycin and monocrotaline animal models reduces blood and lung tissue fibrocytes and reduces serum CXCL12 and CXCL12/CXCR4 lung expression.\nCONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Targeting IL-11 reduces fibrocyte circulation and lung accumulation in animal models of pulmonary hypertension-associated lung fibrosis.", "pmid": "38679415", "score": 4, "selected": true}, {"title": "Continuous heart monitoring in patients with pulmonary hypertension smartwatches and direct transmission to their electronic health records: A trial design.", "authors_str": "Andersen M\u00d8; Carlsen J", "doi": "10.1016/j.cct.2024.107548", "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pulmonary hypertension is a progressive disease for which early treatment interventions are essential.

Our data collection included measurements of brain natriuretic peptide (pro-BNP), cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET), pulmonary function test (PFT), impulse oscillometry (IOS), and FeNO levels. Additionally, we assessed World Health Organization functional class (WHO-FC) of each patient.\nRESULTS: (1) The fractional exhaled concentration of nitric oxide was notably higher in patients with IPAH compared to those with MCTD-PH.

Candidate gene biomarkers were selected using three different machine-learning algorithms (SVM-RFE, LASSO, RF).The diagnostic efficacy of these foundational genes was validated using independent datasets. Eventually, we validated molecular docking and medication prediction. We found 62 common DEGs, including several ones that could be enriched for Immune Response and Inflammation. Two DEGs (SELE and CCL20) could be identified by machine-learning algorithms. They performed well in diagnostic tests on independent datasets.

A defining feature of PAH is the inappropriate remodeling of pulmonary arteries (PA) leading to right ventricle failure and death. Although treatment of PAH has improved, the long-term prognosis for patients remains poor, and more effective targets are needed.\nMETHODS: Gene expression was analyzed by microarray, RNA sequencing, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, and immunostaining of lung and isolated PA in multiple mouse and rat models of pulmonary hypertension (PH) and human PAH. PH was assessed by digital ultrasound, hemodynamic measurements, and morphometry.\nRESULTS: Microarray analysis of the transcriptome of hypertensive rat PA identified a novel candidate, PBK (PDZ-binding kinase), that was upregulated in multiple models and species including humans. PBK is a serine/threonine kinase with important roles in cell proliferation that is minimally expressed in normal tissues but significantly increased in highly proliferative tissues. PBK was robustly upregulated in the medial layer of PA, where it overlaps with markers of smooth muscle cells. Gain-of-function approaches show that active forms of PBK increase PA smooth muscle cell proliferation, whereas silencing PBK, dominant negative PBK, and pharmacological inhibitors of PBK all reduce proliferation. Pharmacological inhibitors of PBK were effective in PH reversal strategies in both mouse and rat models, providing translational significance. In a complementary genetic approach, PBK was knocked out in rats using CRISPR/Cas9 editing, and loss of PBK prevented the development of PH. We found that PBK bound to PRC1 (protein regulator of cytokinesis 1) in PA smooth muscle cells and that multiple genes involved in cytokinesis were upregulated in experimental models of PH and human PAH. Active PBK increased PRC1 phosphorylation and supported cytokinesis in PA smooth muscle cells, whereas silencing or dominant negative PBK reduced cytokinesis and the number of cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle.\nCONCLUSIONS: PBK is a newly described target for PAH that is upregulated in proliferating PA smooth muscle cells, where it contributes to proliferation through changes in cytokinesis and cell cycle dynamics to promote medial thickening, fibrosis, increased PA resistance, elevated right ventricular systolic pressure, right ventricular remodeling, and PH.", "pmid": "38682326", "score": 2, "selected": true}, {"title": "Carotid Baroreceptor Stimulation Improves Pulmonary Arterial Remodeling and Right Ventricular Dysfunction in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension.", "authors_str": "Wang J; Chen J; Shu L; Zhang R; Dai M; Fang X; Hu Z; Xiao L; Xi Z; Zhang J; Bao M", "doi": "10.1016/j.jacbts.2024.01.012", "abstract": "Autonomic nervous system imbalance is intricately associated with the severity and prognosis of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).

Data on demographics, treatment characteristics, and death was collected. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to calculate cumulative probabilities of survival at 1, 3, and 5\u00a0years.\nRESULTS: Five hundred forty-seven patients (90.7% female) with SSc-PAH were identified. Median age at PAH diagnosis was 59.9 (50.0-67.4) years. During a median follow-up duration of 3.2 (1.5-4.8) years, 199 (36.4%) deaths occurred. Estimated survival rates at 1, 3, and 5\u00a0years were 90.2%, 73.2%, and 56.6%, respectively. Survival was similar among patients with and without interstitial lung disease (p\u2009=\u20090.20).

However, the characterization and role of eccDNAs in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) remain unclear.\nMETHODS: In the discovery cohort, we first explored eccDNA expression profiles by Circle-sequencing analysis. The candidate eccDNAs were validated by routine polymerase chain reaction (PCR), TOPO-TA cloning and Sanger sequencing. In the validation cohort, 30 patients with PAH and 10 healthy controls were recruited for qPCR amplification to detect the candidate eccDNAs. Datas at the baseline were collected, including clinical background, biochemical variables, echocardiography and hemodynamic factors. Receiver operating characteristic curve was used to investigate the diagnostic effect of the eccDNA.\nRESULTS: We identified a total of 21,741 eccDNAs in plasma samples of 3 IPAH patients and 3 individuals in good health, and the expression frequency, GC content, length distribution, and genome distribution of the eccDNAs were thoroughly characterized and analyzed. In the validation cohort, 687 eccDNAs were differentially expressed in patients with IPAH compared with healthy controls (screening threshold: |FC|\u22652 and P\u2009<\u20090.05).

Here, we report a role for NKX2-5 in vascular smooth muscle cell phenotypic modulation in vitro and in vascular remodelling in vivo. NKX2-5 is up-regulated in scleroderma (SSc) patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Suppression of NKX2-5 expression in smooth muscle cells, halted vascular smooth muscle proliferation and migration, enhanced contractility and blocked the expression of the extracellular matrix genes. Conversely, overexpression of NKX2-5 suppressed the expression of contractile genes (ACTA2, TAGLN, CNN1) and enhanced the expression of matrix genes (COL1) in vascular smooth muscle cells. In vivo, conditional deletion of NKX2-5 attenuated blood vessel remodelling and halted the progression to hypertension in the mouse chronic hypoxia mouse model. This study revealed that signals related to injury such as serum and low confluence, which induce NKX2-5 expression in cultured cells, is potentiated by TGF\u03b2 and further enhanced by hypoxia. The effect of TGF\u03b2 was sensitive to ERK5 and PI3K inhibition.

In this study, we report the use of hot-melt extrusion (HME) as a scalable process for making Poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microparticles with high SC load. The prepared particles were tested in vitro for local drug delivery to the lungs by inhalation. Sodium bicarbonate was included as a porogen in the formulation to make the particles more brittle and to impart favorable aerodynamic properties. Six formulations were prepared with different formulation compositions. Laser diffraction analysis was used to estimate the geometric particle size distribution of the microparticles.

As immunity has been involved in the development and progression of vascular lesions in PAH, we review the potential contribution of B-cells in its pathogenesis and evaluate the relevance of B-cell-targeted therapies. Circulating B-cell homeostasis is altered in PAH patients, with total B-cell lymphopenia, abnormal subset distribution (expansion of na\u00efve and antibody-secreting cells, reduction of memory B-cells) and chronic activation. B-cells are recruited to the lungs through local chemokine secretion, and activated by several mechanisms: 1) interaction with lung vascular autoantigens through cognate B-cell receptors; 2) costimulatory signals provided by T follicular helper cells (interleukin (IL)-21), type 2 T helper cells and mast cells (IL-4, IL-6 and IL-13); and 3) increased survival signals provided by B-cell activating factor pathways. This activity results in the formation of germinal centres within perivascular tertiary lymphoid organs and in the local production of pathogenic autoantibodies that target the pulmonary vasculature and vascular stabilisation factors (including angiotensin-II/endothelin-1 receptors and bone morphogenetic protein receptors). B-cells also mediate their effects through enhanced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, reduced anti-inflammatory properties by regulatory B-cells, immunoglobulin (Ig)G-induced complement activation, and IgE-induced mast cell activation.
